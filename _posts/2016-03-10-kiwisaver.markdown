title: Choosing a Socially Responsible Kiwisaver Scheme
layout: post

I recently found myself making significant contributions to Kiwisaver for the first time so I decided to put an appropriate amount of effort into choosing the best Kiwisaver scheme.

With all my spending, I try to follow Ghandi's [misquoted](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/falser-words-were-never-spoken.html?_r=0) advice:

When it comes to investing, this means investing in companies which are making a positive contribution to society & the environment. From my cursory analysis of the 189 available Kiwisaver schemes there are 5 that are specifically targeted at investors like me.

### [QuayStreet Balanced SRI Fund](http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/craigs-investment-partners-kiwistart-defined-scheme---balanced-sri-fund-craigs-investment-partners-/)

Provided by _Craigs Investment Partners_ this fund invests in investments that Craigs "deems to be environmentally sustainable or socially responsible". A pretty broad mandate.

**Risk Profile:** Balanced

**Members:** 318

**Total Value:** $4,713,552


### [Socially Responsible Investment Growth Fund](http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/)

Provided by _Grosvenor Investment Management_, this fund "will exclude companies and other investments where the underlying activities are principally involved in the tobacco, alcohol, gambling and armaments industries" which is a pretty low bar.

**Risk Profile:** Growth

**Members:** 1,556

**Total Value:** $16,999,866


### [Socially Responsible Investment Balanced Fund](http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-balanced-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/)

Provided by _Grosvenor Investment Management_, this fund will exclude "investments which do not satisfy certain socially responsible investment criteria".

**Risk Profile:** Balanced

**Members:** 4,031

**Total Value:** $17,854,622


### [Sustainable International Share Fund](http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/oneanswer-kiwisaver-scheme---sustainable-international-share-fund-anz-new-zealand-investments-limited/)

Provided by _ANZ_, this fund invests exclusively in the [Global Sustainable Equity Fund](http://funds.ft.com/uk/Tearsheet/Summary?s=LU0119216553:EUR) which "combines respect for social principles (such as human rights, non-discrimination and the issue of child labour) and environmental principles with good financial prospects". 

Despite only investing on one fund, this scheme still manages to charge above average fees.

**Risk Profile:** Aggressive

**Members:** 362

**Total Value:** $4,305,412


### [Ethica Fund](http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/superlife---ethica-pool-superlife-limited/)

Provided by _Superlife_, this fund "looks to avoid investments in the areas of pornography, gambling, tobacco, alcohol, armaments and fossil fuel extraction".

**Risk Profile:** Balanced

**Members:** 937

**Total Value:** $12,406,942

There are other options. Craigs offers [a scheme where you can pick your own stocks](https://www.craigsip.com/services/kiwisaver.aspx), and there may be other schemes which invest in a responsible manner but don't explicitly flag that as their intention.

Looking purely at social responsibility it seems like the [Socially Responsible Investment Growth Fund](http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/) is the best option, but I will be following up some of the others for more details of their investment criteria. There are other factors to consider of course, such as risk profile, returns, and fees.
