# Choosing a Socially Responsible Kiwisaver Scheme

I recently found myself making significant contributions to Kiwisaver for the first time so I decided to put some effort into choosing the best Kiwisaver scheme.

With all my spending, I try to follow Ghandi's advice, to be the change you want to see in the world. When it comes to investing, which is what Kiwisaver is: an investment, this means investing in companies which are making a positive contribution to society & the environment.

From my cursory analysis of the 189 available Kiwisaver schemes there are 5 that are targeted at investors like me.

### QuayStreet Balanced SRI Fund

Provided by _Craigs Investment Partners_ this fund invests in investments that Craigs "deems to be environmentally sustainable or socially responsible". A pretty broad mandate.
