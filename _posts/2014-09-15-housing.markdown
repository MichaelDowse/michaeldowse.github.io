title: "Housing availability: Renting vs buying"
---

I've been thinking about buying a house. I'm currently living in Newtown for the second time and I like it here, it's close to town, but not in town and has it's own community feel. A couple of months ago I started going to open homes to get a feel for the market. As time goes by I'm more and more ready to buy a house, and I'm becoming increasingly disappointed with what's available on the market. Everything is expensive, really expensive.

After contemplating the reality that I may still be renting next year I had a brief look at the places to rent in Newtown on TradeMe. There are currently 57 properties available to rent in Newtown, which seemed like a lot considering that there are only 16 properties for sale. I was curious to see if this ratio was part of a bigger trend:

                    Rent      Buy
    NZ              10,172    Over 32,000
    Auckland City   1,507     1,674
    Wellington      913       952

Ok, so the disparity I observed in Newtown isn't a nationwide trend. In general there are far more properties for sale than for rent, but in cities the split is pretty much 50/50. That makes sense. Let's take a closer look at some popular Wellington suburbs[1]:

                    Rent      Buy       Rent/Buy
    Brooklyn        36        25        1.44
    Churton Park    10        28        0.3571
    Haitaitai       23        21        1.0952
    Johnsonville    34        49        0.6938
    Karori          49        46        1.0652
    Kelburn         34        19        1.7895
    Khandallah      32        49        0.6531
    Kilbirnie       21        6         3.5
    Miramar         23        32        0.7188
    Mt Cook         26        30        0.8667
    Mt Victoria     41        13        3.1538
    Newlands        18        48        0.375
    Newtown         57        16        3.5625
    Oriental Bay    16        39        0.4103
    Tawa            14        47        0.2979
    Te Aro          59        109       0.5413
    Thorndon        37        45        0.8222
    Wadestown       23        8         2.875
    CBD             158       112       1.4107

Turns out, the ratio of houses for sale vs to rent varies widely. Newtown has the highest ratio of houses to rent vs houses for sale (Kilbirnie is a close second but at much lower volume). In contrast, Tawa and Newlands have far more houses for sale than for rent. Off the top of my head I can think of a few possible explanations for these variations, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. One complicating factor is that many rental properties in Wellington are on 12 month leases which renew early in the year (usually February).
