<p>I recently found myself making significant contributions to Kiwisaver for the first time so I decided to put some effort into choosing the best Kiwisaver scheme.</p>

<p>With all my spending, I try to follow Ghandi’s advice, to be the change you want to see in the world. When it comes to investing, which is what Kiwisaver is: an investment, this means investing in companies which are making a positive contribution to society &amp; the environment.</p>

<p>From my cursory analysis of the 189 available Kiwisaver schemes there are 5 that are targeted at investors like me.</p>

<h3 id="quaystreet-balanced-sri-fund">QuayStreet Balanced SRI Fund</h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Craigs Investment Partners</em> this fund invests in investments that Craigs “deems to be environmentally sustainable or socially responsible”. A pretty broad mandate.</p>

<p>Its top non-cash investments are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-kld-400-social-index.pdf">A social index of US stocks</a></li>
  <li>Telstra</li>
  <li>Stockland</li>
  <li>ANZ</li>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>NAB</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided by <em>Grosvenor Investment Management</em>, this fund “will exclude companies and other investments where the underlying activities are principally involved in the tobacco, alcohol, gambling and armaments industries” which is a pretty low bar.</p>
