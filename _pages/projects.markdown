## SpendSheet

A new bottom up approach to budgeting. I've worked on a couple of personal finance products in the past, and made a couple of previous attempts at building a personal finance app that works for me.

## HabitBot

A data tracking, habit forming, troubleshooting tool. I'm currently just using this myself but aim to make it more widely available soon.

## StuffByRSS

An experiment in making local news a bit less clickbaity and distracting. Stuff.co.nz is my best source for local news here in Wellington, New Zealand but using the site can be a traumatic experience. I took the RSS feeds which seem to have longer, less clickbaity headlines and combined with the [Readability](https://readability.com/) API for a minimalist reading experience.

## Go Vocab

I spent 3 years working on Go Vocab with my co founder <a href="http://jeremygeros.com">Jeremy</a>. After realising that our business model required a lot of sales work and we hated sales, we moved on and made the site free. Go Vocab is still used to teach languages in many schools around the world.
