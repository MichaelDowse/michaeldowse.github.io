title: "Budgeting"
---

This year I've found myself with a regular routine and a regular income which seemed to be draining out of my bank account impossibly fast so I decided to have a go at budgeting. 

I set a goal of spending $500 a week to spend, setting the rest aside for tax, savings, international travel, whatever. 

Every week $250 goes to a joint account to cover rent, bills and groceries. That leaves $250 to cover everything else: food, entertainment, transport and one off expenses like a new iPhone, clothes, haircuts, domestic travel. 

Another thing to note: I consider this money allocated for spending, not saving. So if I have money left at the end of the week then I should allocate it to larger purchases which are split across several weeks like a new iPhone. 

There's a neat app I use on my computer called Rescuetime which tracks how I use my computer and then categorizes my time as productive, neutral or unproductive. So an hour spent programming would be considered productive and an hour spent on Facebook would be considered unproductive. Of course I have control over which activities are classified as productive or unproductive.

I wondered if I could do he same think with my budgeting. The way I see it, money is something I can use to survive, but beyond that it can also be used to achieve my goals in life. 

So I classified my expenses using these rules:

1. _Expenses that are essential to survive (rent, groceries) are neutral._

2. _Expenses that help me achieve my goals (a tent for tramping, a trip to Queenstown for the marathon) are productive._

3. _Expenses that do neither of the above (eating out, Netflix) are unproductive._

There are exceptions of course. For example, if I eat out with friends then I'll count that expense as productive because spending time with friends is good and something I should do more of even though I haven't explicitly stated it as a goal.

That probably sounds horribly confusing so far but it works, here's what it looks like for the past 3 weeks:

                        Week Ending 14/9	    Week Ending 21/9	    Week Ending 28/9
    Total Spending      $410.06	              $434.42	              $409.08
    Productive          $34.16	              $38.72	              $25.00
    Neutral             $316.50	              $270.00	              $255.00
    Unproductive        $59.40	              $125.70	              $129.08

Since I started budgeting this way the amount I've been spending per week has been steadily decreasing (which leaves more money for stuff like my upcoming trip to do the Queen Charlotte track). I think it's one of those cases where just being aware of something is enough to improve it.
