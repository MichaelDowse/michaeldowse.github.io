This weekend Som and I went for a quick overnight tramp into the [Orongorongo Valley](http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/wellington-kapiti/wellington/catchpool-and-orongorongo-valleys/). The goal was to test out a bunch of new gear and generally make sure we're ready to tackle some bigger tramps like the Queen Charlotte.

We followed the track along the Catchpool Valley until it met the Orongorongo Valley, then walked upriver a bit until we found a suitable campsite.

For Dinner we cooked pasta with  eggplant and mushrooms and for breakfast we had Banana Loaf (prepared earlier). Then on sunday morning we walked back the way we came in.

There was only one slight mishap: I left the car keys at the campsite and didn't notice until we were 15 minutes into the walk home. Thankfully they were exactly where I left them.

All our gear worked great and so now we're all set for the next adventure. The weather was perfect and it didn't rain at all, which is great, though it means that the waterproofness of my new tent remains untested.
