I've always struggled with blogging. I want to do it, I have things that I want to share. But it always happens in bursts, a few good posts create a high bar for future posts, which get half written but never published.

Mostly I agonise over what I should be blogging about. Should I post my travel pictures? Should I be posting my own introspections? Or should I be posting my commentary on things? <!--more-->To help reduce my future agonising I've come up with two rules for this blog:

**1) Posts things of interest to others**

This is a public blog, not a personal diary. It's not for my aimless musings. I mean it is for that, but not only that, and only when they might be of interest to others.

**2) Post things that no-one else could post**

I don't want to write the same things that everyone else is writing. This means posts must have a personal angle, which sets up a tight balancing act with rule number one. Posts must be personal, but also of interest to others.

These two rules don't eliminate any of the post types I described above: I can, and will, still post travel pictures, introspections, and commentary.

Let's see how long this burst lasts.
