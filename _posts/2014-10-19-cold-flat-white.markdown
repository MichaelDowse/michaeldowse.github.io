Last year the Iced Mocha was my drink; a cold coffee with chocolate, and either ice cream or ice. Some would say it's not a real coffee, I say it's delicious.

It may seem impractical to drink iced coffee in winter, it didn't stop me, but some find the idea a bit jarring. Anyway, now that summer is approaching there's no excuse not to embrace iced coffee. <!--more-->

Earlier this year I discovered my favorite coffee of all: the Cold Flat White from [People's Coffee](http://peoplescoffee.co.nz/) (conveniently located only a few blocks from my house in Newtown). The Cold Flat White is a simple drink: cold brewed coffee, milk, and a touch of Maple Syrup. It's delicious and I strongly recommend trying it.

Two problems: it costs $6 and is only available in Newtown. I needed an affordable and never ending supply of this stuff so I started making my own. That's right, I make Cold Flat Whites at home and you can too. 

### Step 1: Cold Brew Coffee

Turns out [cold brewing coffee is stupidly simple](http://boingboing.net/2013/07/20/cheap-easy-no-mess-cold-brew.html). Get some medium grind coffee, put it in a giant teabag (more specifically a nut milk bag, like you'd use to make almond milk), put it in some water and leave it overnight.

I was doubtful that the giant teabag approach could work as well as a Chemex filter, and having never used a Chemex I'm still not sure. It worked pretty well though, the resulting coffee was smooth and not at all gritty.

After a night of brewing squeeze the giant teabag so as to extract every last bit of coffee goodness. Then you're left with a strong cold brewed coffee essence, I wouldn't recommend drinking this straight.

If you used a whole bag of coffee like I did then you'll have a lot of this coffee essence. That's alright, it will last a while, store it in the fridge. 

### Step 2: Make a Cold Flat White

Now you're ready to assemble a cold flat white. I'm still experimenting with the ratios here but it goes something like this:

- A couple of drops of Maple Syrup in the bottom of a glass
- Fill the glass with 50% coffee essence
- Fill the rest of the glass with milk

That's really all there is to it, enjoy!

I'm going to keep perfecting this: the next step is to increase the quality of the ingredients: really good freshly ground coffee, really good fresh organic milk, perhaps from Lewis Road Creamery, and real Maple Syrup (I must confess I'm currently using Maple Flavoured syrup).
