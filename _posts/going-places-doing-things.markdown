title: Going places, doing things

_Disclaimer: Obviously the introvert/extrovert is overly reductionist and I probably sit somewhere in between but I still find it a helpful framework for thinking about this stuff._

For quite a while I've had more social events on the list of things I want to do more of.

After going out places and doing things with other people I usually feel more happier, energised and often even super enthused about life. These are effects that rarely come about from spending time alone with a book (or more commonly, the internet).
