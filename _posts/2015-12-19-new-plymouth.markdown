New Plymouth is a lot cooler than it used to be. Som and I headed up there for the weekend a few months ago. In no particular order, here are some highlights.

### The coastal walkway

The coastal walkway is lovely, the water was a bit wild the day we went which made it all the more interesting. Unfortunately not caught on camera: when Som turned to photograph this sign a wave came up from behind and she got soaked.

### The Govett-Brewster Len Lye gallery

The exterior is probably actually the highlight, but the stuff inside is cool too.

### Mount Taranaki

There was too much snow to climb Mount Taranaki without actual mountaineering skills but I've climbed it on a previous trip and it's a pretty awesome hike. When we went in the height of summer there was still snow at the top. If nothing else, it's worth a trip to the visitors center halfway up the mountain for some sweet views.

### Street Art

New Plymouth is the home of [BMD](http://bmdisyourfriend.com/) and there is a lot of their work, and cool work by other artists, throughout the city center.

### Food & drink that was up to the standard of us city folk

- For coffee, head to [Ozone Coffee](http://www.ozonecoffee.com/bean-store.php)
- For brunch, head to [The Federal Store](http://www.thefederalstore.com/)
- For dinner, head to [Pekaren](https://www.facebook.com/PEKAREN-696952050381686/)

**Bonus:** Our AirBnB host was a nudist with a house full of _interesting_ artwork, though the wall to wall mirrors in the shower were a little intimidating.
