<div class="entry-content"><h2>#1kk</h2>

<p>A year ago I wasn’t a runner, I didn’t run. Hadn’t since compulsory cross country in primary school. Now, when asked about my hobbies running is near the top of the list and I’m looking forward to my first half marathon (and hopefully a full marathon soon after). This is the story of how I became a runner.</p>

<p>In December 2012 Som and I started running. It was her idea but I liked it. We ran just a little bit, and very slowly, but we kept doing it, almost every day.</p>

<p>In the New Year <a href="http://www.8degrees.co.nz/2012/12/19/1000-1000/">Vaughan Rowsell announced his intention to run 1,000 kilometres</a> or 1,000,000 metres in 2013. Vaughan dubbed this challenge the #1kk.</p>

<p>Vaughan is a master of year long goals. Past goals of his include cycling the length of New Zealand and not drinking for a year. In contrast I’m not much of a goal setter and I’m even worse at finishing what I start.</p>

<p>Despite this, and despite the fact I could barely run 3k at the time, I committed to the challenge. Signing up is the easy part.</p>

<p>I opted to use the Nike Plus app to track my progress towards the #1kk which means I always take my iPhone with me on runs. If I don’t take the phone, then the run doesn’t count. So far I’ve tripped and fallen twice, damaging my phone on both occasions. The first time the back plate had to be replaced and the second time was scratches on the front. I try to use a case now.</p>

<p>In December I was running in my street shoes (Vans at the time) based on what I had heard from the barefoot running movement that modern running shoes did more harm than good. In January I decided to focus on only one challenge at a time and picked up some running shoes on sale for $100 at Rebel Sport.</p>

<p><img src="/images/1kk/1.jpg" alt="My running shoes" />
<em>My running shoes</em></p>

<p>I didn’t put a lot of thought into my choice, I considered the fit, comfort, colours and price and came up with the Lunarfly trail running shoes from Nike. The fit was a bit tight at first but has come to be perfect as I’ve worn them in. I use these shoes for a lot more than running too, I took them hiking in Patagonia and trekking in Peru. If I’m going away for the weekend then this is the one pair of shoes I take.</p>

<p>Building on the habits we started forming in December we continued running in January, gradually increasing our distance and speed. Moving to Santiago really threw off our barely formed running habits; in February and March we didn’t run at all. The habit was broken and The #1kk was not looking good.</p>

<p>In April we planned a hiking trip to Patagonia and resumed running as training for the trip. We established a simple 5k route from our apartment which we ran most mornings with a longer run on Sundays. After the trip to Patagonia we started running even more. At one point we were running 50k per week, more than twice as much as required for the challenge.</p>

<p><img src="/images/1kk/2.png" alt="I’ve run over 700k so far this year" />
<em>I’ve run over 700k so far this year</em></p>

<p>It’s now the beginning of September, two thirds of the way through the year and I’ve run just over 700 kilometres. That puts me more than 30k ahead of schedule but I expect that lead to disappear fast as I’m traveling at the moment and not running much. It’s likely that December will be a mad rush towards the finish line but what seemed unachievable in March now seems simple: all I have to do is not give up.</p>

<p>That’s what running is about for me: not stopping.</p>

<p>I used to cycle quite a bit, on and off road and when you’re cycling up a hill (or on the flat) you can’t stop pedaling  You can pedal extremely slowly but you can’t stop. If you stop, then best case you’ll roll backwards down the hill, or worst case you’ll tip over sideways.</p>

<p>It’s easier to stop when running, there’s less momentum forcing one foot down in front of the other. This makes for a mental sport. It’s all about the mind games.</p>

<p>YOUTUBE CLIP HERE</p>

<p>At first it was hard to get out of bed every morning, to run, and to keep running when I wanted nothing more than to be back in bed. It’s still hard, some days more than others. But it’s getting easier.</p>

<p>I usually run a line, there and back (as opposed to a loop) and the return journey always feels easier, like running downhill. I’m reminded of a quote from Gattaca when the two brothers are swimming away from shore to see who will chicken out first:</p>

<p><strong>Anton:</strong> Vincent! How are you doing this Vincent? How have you done any of this? We have to go back.</p>

<p><strong>Vincent:</strong> It’s too late for that. We’re closer to the other side.</p>

<p><strong>Anton:</strong> What other side? You wanna drown us both?</p>

<p><strong>Vincent:</strong> You wanna know how I did it? This is how I did it Anton &ndash; I never saved anything for the swim back.</p>

<p>Peer pressure helps, Som and I usually run together and there are many times I’ve thought ‘If I were alone I’d slow down now’, or ‘If I were alone I’d walk for a bit now’. If I’m running alone then music helps too.</p>

<p>The mind games get easier when there’s no doubt that I can’t finish the run. When I set out on a 5, 7, or even 10k run I know I can finish it. I’ve done it 100 times before. Unless there’s something really wrong with me on the day I must be physically capable of finishing the run. There’s no excuse.</p>

<p>Running is a habit, and it naturally builds on itself. Getting out of bed every morning gets easier, putting on the shoes becomes a muscle memory. Every run is easier than the last.</p>

<p>Success in one habit makes it easier to succeed in other habits. I’m trying to introduce more positive habits into my life, and also to apply the discipline I’ve learned from running to other areas. I highly recommend The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg to learn more about the science behind habits.</p>

<p>Though I haven’t finished the #1kk yet I’ve established the habit, and all I have to do now is not stop.</p>
