          </h2>
      
          <p>I’ve been thinking about buying a house. I’m currently living in Newtown for the second time and I like it here, it’s close to town, but not in town and has it’s own community feel. A couple of months ago I started going to open homes to get a feel for the market. As time goes by I’m more and more ready to buy a house, and I’m becoming increasingly disappointed with what’s available on the market. Everything is expensive, really expensive.</p>

<p>After contemplating the reality that I may still be renting next year I had a brief look at the places to rent in Newtown on TradeMe. There are currently 57 properties available to rent in Newtown, which seemed like a lot considering that there are only 16 properties for sale. I was curious to see if this ratio was part of a bigger trend:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                Rent      Buy
NZ              10,172    Over 32,000
Auckland City   1,507     1,674
Wellington      913       952
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ok, so the disparity I observed in Newtown isn’t a nationwide trend. In general there are far more properties for sale than for rent, but in cities the split is pretty much 50/50. That makes sense. Let’s take a closer look at some popular Wellington suburbs[1]:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                Rent      Buy       Rent/Buy
Brooklyn        36        25        1.44

Kilbirnie       21        6         3.5

Oriental Bay    16        39        0.4103
Tawa            14        47        0.2979
Te Aro          59        109       0.5413
Thorndon        37        45        0.8222
Wadestown       23        8         2.875
CBD             158       112       1.4107
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Turns out, the ratio of houses for sale vs to rent varies widely. Newtown has the highest ratio of houses to rent vs houses for sale (Kilbirnie is a close second but at much lower volume). In contrast, Tawa and Newlands have far more houses for sale than for rent. Off the top of my head I can think of a few possible explanations for these variations, but I don’t want to jump to conclusions. One complicating factor is that many rental properties in Wellington are on 12 month leases which renew early in the year (usually February).</p>

<p>[1] Suburbs with either more than 20 properties for sale or more than 20 properties available to rent based on TradeMe listings on the 14th September, 2014.</p>
