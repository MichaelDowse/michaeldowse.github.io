        <a class="post-link" href="/2017/02/27/design-cycles.html">Design cycles</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>You are a startup. You know design is important, so important that you have hired a super talented designer to make sure everything you make is beautiful.</p>

<p>Your designer produces a beautiful new design for your homepage which they predict will boost conversions. You need conversions. You are losing money. You get a developer onto it straight away.</p>

<p><em>Two years pass by…</em></p>

<hr />

<p>You have interfaces everywhere, not because distributed systems are on trend right now but because your customers are distributed. There’s the public website, the web app, the mobile version of the website, the iphone app, the android app, the Tumblr blog, the API documentation, the SaaS Job Board product you’ve integrated with and written a custom theme for.</p>

<p>There are emails as well of course; some from your app and some from your marketing automation system, plus the life cycle emails from that other SaaS product.</p>

<p>You’re launching a new page of your website targeting a new niche of customers. Your designer has done some designs in a super cool new style. It will probably increase conversions, you get a developer onto it straight away.</p>

<p>The thing is, the new designs for the new page don’t really match the rest of the site. It’s kind of a different style. The skeumorphic buttons are out, flat rectangles are in. Textured backgrounds are out, huge background images are in. The logo and branding is the same though.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, nothing really matches. The mobile site looks a bit outdated, but you have apps now. The apps look a bit different to the web app, but your iOS developer is busy on another project. The public facing site looks great, it gets updated the most so it has the latest designs.</p>

<p>The inconsistency bothers you, it’s a bad experience for your customers and it doesn’t look good to prospects, it might even be affecting conversion rates. Design is important. Not more important that conversions or course, but still, it would be nice if everything matched the nice new designs.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>

<p>Visit your banks website, it probably looks pretty nice, that’s because it’s trying to convert you. Now log into online banking, probably not so nice. Now try logging in to your banks online business banking portal, the ones I have seen are all about a decade behind the design of the banks home page.</p>

<p>It’s easy to pick on banks, but every startup that’s been around for more than a couple of years struggles to maintain a cohesive look and feel across all customer touchpoints.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons for this, one I’ve been thinking about lately is about cycle times. More specifically, about the mismatch between an organisation’s design cycle time and its design implementation cycle time. Those are terms I made up, but you can think of them something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Design Cycle Time:</strong> How frequently our visual style changes or evolves, this varies depending on the designer/design team, brand changes as you seek product/market fit etc. For example, it could be about 6 months.</p>

<p><strong>Design Implementation Cycle Time:</strong> The time it takes for all your interfaces to be updated to a new design. In my experience this varies from 3 months to infinite (all interfaces are never brought into alignment), with the median around 2 years.</p>

<p>If your Design Cycle Time is 6 months, and your Design Implementation Cycle Time is 2 years. The customer experience won’t be terrible, but it won’t cohesive, and that holds it back.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  <em>To ensure a mostly consistent customer experience most of the time, a companies design implementation cycle time must be significantly shorter than its design cycle time.<em>


In framing the problem this way, two approaches to solving it emerge: increasing design cycle time, or reducing design implementation cycle time. Ideally both approaches would be pursued in parallel.

Before tackling cycle times though, it is essential to understand your interfaces. I've never witnessed a 'complete redesign' that managed to update every customer touchpoint. There's always something that gets missed.

What about the merch store? What about the knowledge base? What about the monthly newsletter? These are the less important customer touchpoints but they all contribute to that feeling of cohesion, where the experience just feels right.

Once all of your interfaces are documented, then you can begin to make improvements.

### To increase Design Cycle Time

- **Avoid trends, stick to the classics**

- **Design in a wider context**

- **Keep short lived designs contained:** Sometimes visual styles have to change fast, that's how marketing campaigns work. They just need to be treated as such. Design changes for a particular campaign should be implemented as a skin, or theme across the more permanent "evergreen" style to make removing them at the end of the campaign simple.

### To decrease Design Implementation Cycle Time

- **Know your interfaces:** Know what interfaces you have, where they are and maintain the capability to update them.

- **Pattern Libraries:** A topic for another blog post, but a well maintained and used pattern library really is the best solution.

- **Update designs by default:** When working on an interface, never leave a interface without updating the design.

<hr />

<p>I try to spend in a responsible way, considering the direct &amp; indirect consequences of my purchases. Not all my spending is conscious in this way, it’s hard work to put so much thought into each purchase. Some heuristics are now starting to emerge which I hope to document soon.</p>

<p>Some (unordered) attributes I think about when spending money consciously:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consumption of the product is good for me personally</li>
  <li>My consumption of the product is not detrimental to society as a whole</li>
  <li>The company treats staff well</li>
  <li>Sustainable supply chain</li>
  <li>The end product is sustainable</li>
</ul>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2016/04/17/tasty.html">Tasty</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>If you use Facebook, you’ve probably noticed the recipe videos from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty/?fref=ts">Tasty</a> frequently featuring on your news feed. They’re everywhere right now.</p>

<p>To go viral on Facebook a video needs to catch your attention, without any sound, while you’re scrolling through the news feed. The Tasty videos do that, I stop scrolling every time. Here’s one for example:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbuzzfeedtasty%2Fvideos%2F1741611326091509%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560" width="560" height="425" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Given this, I wasn’t particularly surprised to find out that Tasty is a part of Buzzfeed. I normally don’t like viral things in my feed but I do like these Tasty videos and I’ve been able to rationalise a couple of possible justifications:</p>

<p><strong>Cooking is a good thing that we should do more of and Tasty videos encourage that</strong></p>

<p>Most people agree that we should cook more. Just like we should exercise more, or read more books. These are things that most people feel are positive influences on their lives, and that we should do more of.</p>

<p>You could say that reality shows like MasterChef encourage cooking, and for some people they probably do, but they also promote sitting on the couch watching other people cook, and then paying exorbitant prices to eat a meal prepared in a kitched overseen by a “MasterChef”.</p>

<p>Tasty videos serve less as entertainment and more as inspiration. While you couldn’t make the meal just from watching the video, you <em>almost</em> could, and there’s always a link to the full recipe attached.</p>

<p><strong>They promote <em>good</em> cooking</strong></p>

<p>Tasty recipes tend to start from scratch, using basic ingredients. There are no cake mixes, or pre-made anything.</p>

<p>The only inputs into the videos are relatively unprocessed ingredients that can be found in any supermarket, showing a committment to recipes that people can actually make at home. It’s just good business sense really, as the recipes need to appeal to people all over the world. Some of the competitors who have popped up are less principled, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/foodbyshared/videos/1018342061536144/?fref=nf">like this example</a>.</p>

<p>The recipes are often not particularly simple (though the video format makes them look deceptively so). They encourage the idea that cooking takes effort, but that your effort will be rewarded.</p>

<hr />

<p>Convinced? Here’s a couple more:</p>

      <p>I recently found myself making significant contributions to Kiwisaver for the first time so I decided to put an appropriate amount of effort into choosing the best Kiwisaver scheme.</p>

<p>With all my spending, I try to follow Ghandi’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/falser-words-were-never-spoken.html?_r=0">misquoted</a> advice:</p>

<p>There are other options. Craigs offers <a href="https://www.craigsip.com/services/kiwisaver.aspx">a scheme where you can pick your own stocks</a>, and there may be other schemes which invest in a responsible manner but don’t explicitly flag that as their intention.</p>

<p>Looking purely at social responsibility it seems like the <a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/">Socially Responsible Investment Growth Fund</a> is the best option, but I will be following up some of the others for more details of their investment criteria. There are other factors to consider of course, such as risk profile, returns, and fees.</p>

      <p>New Plymouth is a lot cooler than it used to be. Som and I headed up there for the weekend a few months ago. In no particular order, some highlights were:</p>

<h3 id="the-coastal-walkway">The coastal walkway</h3>

<p><img src="/images/newplymouth/walkway.jpg" alt="BMD" /></p>

<p>The coastal walkway is lovely, the water was a bit wild the day we went which made it all the more interesting. Unfortunately not caught on camera: when Som turned to photograph this sign a wave came up from behind and she got soaked.</p>

<h3 id="the-govett-brewster-len-lye-gallery">The Govett-Brewster Len Lye gallery</h3>

<p><img src="/images/newplymouth/lenlye.jpg" alt="BMD" /></p>

<p>The exterior is probably actually the highlight, but the stuff inside is cool too.</p>

<h3 id="mount-taranaki">Mount Taranaki</h3>

<p><img src="/images/newplymouth/taranaki.jpg" alt="BMD" /></p>

<p>There was too much snow to climb Mount Taranaki without actual mountaineering skills but I’ve climbed it on a previous trip and it’s a pretty awesome hike. When we went in the height of summer there was still snow at the top. If nothing else, it’s worth a trip to the visitors center halfway up the mountain for some sweet views.</p>

<h3 id="street-art">Street Art</h3>

<p>New Plymouth is the home of <a href="http://bmdisyourfriend.com/">BMD</a> and there is a lot of their work, and cool work by other artists, throughout the city center.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2015/12/19/blogging-goals.html">Rules of the blog</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>I’ve always struggled with blogging. I want to do it, I have things that I want to share. But it always happens in bursts, a few good posts create a high bar for future posts, which get half written but never published.</p>

<p>Mostly I agonise over what I should be blogging about. Should I post my travel pictures? Should I be posting my own introspections? Or should I be posting my commentary on things? To help reduce my future agonising I’ve come up with two rules for this blog:</p>

<p><strong>1) Posts things of interest to others</strong></p>

<p>This is a public blog, not a personal diary. It’s not for my aimless musings. I mean it is for that, but not only that, and only when they might be of interest to others.</p>

<p><strong>2) Post things that no-one else could post</strong></p>

<p>I don’t want to write the same things that everyone else is writing. This means posts must have a personal angle, which sets up a tight balancing act with rule number one. Posts must be personal, but also of interest to others.</p>

<p>These two rules don’t eliminate any of the post types I described above: I can, and will, still post travel pictures, introspections, and commentary.</p>

<p>Let’s see how long this burst lasts.</p>

      <p>We caught the train up to Mt Ruapehu on the weekend and caught the chairlift up to the new Knoll Ridge Cafe which is a very cool building (and has won at least one architecture award).</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2014/11/02/lemon-curd.html">Lemon Curd</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>At the end of last year my friend Joel introduced me to Lemon Curd, or more specifally, to Lemon Curd on toast. I’d had lemon curd before, it’s commonly used in desserts, but using it as a breakfast spread was new to me, and I liked it.</p>

<p>So… I tried making Lemon Curd myself (sorry, this is turning into a cooking blog). I used the recipe provided by Joel which is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>4 large lemons</li>
  <li>100g butter</li>
  <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Grate the rind &amp; squeeze the juice of the lemons into a saucepan</li>
  <li>Cut butter into small cubes</li>
  <li>Beat the eggs</li>
  <li>Add the butter eggs and sugar to the saucepan and stir over a very low heat until the sugar has dissolved &amp; the curd has thickened</li>
  <li>Pour mixture into hot sterilized jar</li>
  <li>Let it stand to cool to room temperature then place in fridge</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/lemon_curd.jpg" alt="There's lemon zest somewhere underneath all that sugar" /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It turned out pretty well! Ideally it would have been a bit thicker (I didn’t really have the patience for stirring slowly over a very low heat for too long), but the taste is just right.</p>
