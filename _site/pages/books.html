<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/what_got_you_here.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>What got you here won't get you there</h2>
    <blockquote>Marshall Goldsmith</blockquote>
    <p>This is basically a book about fundamental attribution bias in the workplace. The author is an executive coach claiming that we all have traits that we think we are succeeding because of, but actually are succeeding in spite of. He then drills down into what these traits commonly are and how to go about changing our behaviour for the better.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/seveneves.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Seveneves</h2>
    <blockquote>Neal Stephenson</blockquote>
    <p>It's clear by now that I'll probably enjoy anything Neal Stephenson writes...</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/norwegian_wood.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Norwegian Wood</h2>
    <blockquote>Haruki Murakami</blockquote>
    <p>Murakami has been on my list forever and after discussing his works with my brother I finally got around to reading one. I'm now contemplating which to read next.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/diamond_age.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Diamond Age</h2>
    <blockquote>Neal Stephenson</blockquote>
    <p>I enjoyed this even more than Snow Crash, but I'm not sure if that's just because I have a daughter.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/101_things_architecture.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>101 Things I Learned In Architecture School</h2>
    <blockquote>Matthew Frederick</blockquote>
    <p>More literal prep for architecture. A short, efficient read. A lot easier than going to architecture school (I dropped out).</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/the_managers_path.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Manager's Path</h2>
    <blockquote>Camille Fournier</blockquote>
    <p>A very practical look at the life of a manager in the software industry.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/timeless_way_of_building.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The timeless way of building</h2>
    <blockquote>Christopher Alexander</blockquote>
    <p>I briefly enrolled in architecture school and did a bunch of reading in preparation, not that Christopher Alexander agrees with the approach taught in architecture school at all. Every book about (building) architecture I read seems to give me more ideas on perspectives on software architecture.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/stories_of_your_life.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Stories of your life and others</h2>
    <blockquote>Ted Chiang</blockquote>
    <p>The film Arrival was based on one of the short stories in this book. All the stories in here are great.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/peopleware.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Peopleware</h2>
    <blockquote>Tom DeMarco &amp; Timothy Lister</blockquote>
    <p>I recently started doing less coding and more "not coding" at work so over the christmas break I started reading the literature on software management. This is the one book that is always recommended, and though some of the ideas come across as a bit dated, most of it is still highly applicable.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/red_mars.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Red Mars</h2>
    <blockquote>Kim Stanley Robinson</blockquote>
    <p>Slowly making my way through the Sci Fi classics. This was a great read, but not quite great enough for me to read the sequels at this stage.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/marie_kondo.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying</h2>
    <blockquote>Marie Kondo</blockquote>
    <p>I honestly did not realise that this book was a big deal. I heard it recommended by one person and started reading it. In the following weeks I started hearing it mentioned everywhere.</p>

    <p>I really enjoyed it, but I am already a huge fan of minimalism and living in tidy, well organised spaces.</p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/snow_crash.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Snow Crash</h2>
    <blockquote>Neal Stephenson</blockquote>
    <p>Neal Stephenson has been on my list to read for years and did not disappoint.</p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/beacon_23.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Beacon 23</h2>
    <blockquote>Hugh Howey</blockquote>
    <p>I read pretty much anything Hugh Howey writes. The range of his ideas continues to impress me.</p>

</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/creativity_inc.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Creativity Inc.</h2>

    <p>This is the book I would recommend to anyone trying to build products.</p>

</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/readyplayerone.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Ready Player One</h2>
    <blockquote>Ernest Cline</blockquote>
    <p>Fun read, couldn't put it down. Now a major motion picture (TM). It's looking unlikely the movie will be better than book.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline-ebook/dp/B004J4WKUQ">Kindle eBook</a></p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/compelling.png" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Compelling Science Fiction issues 1 &amp; 2</h2>
    <blockquote>Edited by Joe Stech</blockquote>
    <p>A free online science fiction magazine. The first two issues were good but I've fallen behind and haven't read any further than that.</p>
    <p><a href="http://compellingsciencefiction.com/">Free online, paid subscription for Kindle</a></p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/sisters_keeper.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>My Sisters Keeper</h2>
    <blockquote>Jodi Picoult</blockquote>
    <p>I read this the old fashioned way. I looked at the bookshelf and picked a book that caught my eye. It's on Kindle though so you don't have to do that. There's even a movie.</p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/nightfall.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Nightfall</h2>
    <blockquote>Isaac Asimov</blockquote>
    <p>More evidence that the short story is the best format for Science Fiction.</p>

  <img src="/images/books/prey.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Prey</h2>
    <blockquote>Michael Critchton</blockquote>
    <p>After a while all Michael Crichton books kinda seem the same. This will probably be the last one for me, still a fun read though.</p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/crossed.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Crossed</h2>
    <blockquote>Evelyn Blackwell</blockquote>
    <p>The story of a hypothetical future where a younger generation value the environment more than humanity itself. Many interesting ideas in here, my favourite being Intersectional Veganism (which it turns out is actually a thing).</p>

    <p>As <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRPEHLW2AL34/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B010EO3A3K&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text">an Amazon reviewer notes</a>, <em>Crossed</em> does a great job of capturing the way movements form online in todays society, which is relatively rare in Science Fiction.</p>

  <img src="/images/books/wonder_weeks.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Wonder Weeks</h2>
    <blockquote>Hetty van de Rijt Ph.D, Frans Plooij Ph.D</blockquote>
    <p>I recently became a father and this is the one thing that has been recommended to me the most. It's a book (and also an app) describing the developmental leaps a baby goes through in the first 20 months of their life. I'm not sure I'd recommend reading it in advance of becoming a parent, but it is very interesting.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Weeks-Hetty-Rijt-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B007NNYGHU">Kindle eBook</a> (&amp; app in the app store)</p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/hpmor.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Harry Potter and the methods of rationality</h2>
    <blockquote>Eliezer Yudkowsky</blockquote>
    <p>Yes it's a fanfic and can drag on a bit (it's also really long), but this is a must read, or at least must-start-reading for any Harry Potter fan.</p>
    <p>Methods of Rationality is set in an alternative universe where Petunia married a biochemist and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Harry then proceeds to approach the wizarding world with the full knowledge and intelligence of the author, a Research Fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute.</p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/the_dark_forest.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Dark Forest</h2>
    <blockquote>Cixin Liu</blockquote>
    <p>This is the second in the trilogy, and even better than the first. Now to wait for the third (and final) book to be translated...</p>

    <p>Again, I couldn't find a legal way to buy a digital version of this in New Zealand.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/three_body_problem.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Three-Body Problem</h2>
    <blockquote>Cixin Liu</blockquote>
    <p>Originally witten in Chinese and recently translated to English. I didn't really notice the translation, so it must have been ok.</p>

    <p><em>The Three-Body Problem</em> and its sequel are the best Science Fiction I've read in quite a while. If you're at all interested in hard sci fi, I highly recommend this trilogy.</p>

    <p>I couldn't find a legal way to buy a digital version of this in New Zealand but managed to buy an ebook from a UK store and convert for Kindle.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
</div>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/brave_new_world.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Brave New World</h2>
    <blockquote>Aldous Huxley</blockquote>
    <p>I've been meaning to read this for a long time, after hearing people say that our future is looking less like <em>1984</em> and more like <em>Brave New World</em>. Whoever said that, they're right.</p>

    <p><em>Brave New World</em> paints a pretty bleak picture, though large parts now seem so dated that they distract from the plausibility. A though provoking read nonetheless.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-World-Aldous-Huxley-ebook/dp/B010YGR35E/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443090041&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brave+new+world">Kindle eBook</a>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/object_oriented_design.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</h2>
    <blockquote>Sandi Metz</blockquote>
    <p>I rarely read technical books but really enjoyed this one. It helped to solidify and give names to a lot of patterns that were already floating around in my head.</p>

    <p>There's nothing too radical in here, but a good summary/explanation of some OO techniques/strategies. Relevant for any language, not just Ruby. Probably only relevant to software developers though.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B0096BYG7C/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">Kindle eBook</a>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/the_martian.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Martian</h2>
    <blockquote>Andy Weir</blockquote>
    <p>A couple of months ago everyone in the office started talking about this book, so I read it, and I was not disappointed. An astronout is stranded on Mars and attempts to survive on Mars until he can be rescued.</p>

    <p>What makes this book so good is the survival techniques used and the detail and accuracy with which they are described. <em>The Martian</em> reads almost like a Mars survival guide. It's now been made into a film starring Matt Damon which I'm very much looking forward to seeing.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00FAXJHCY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443090133&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+martian">Kindle eBook</a>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/the_lost_world.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>The Lost World</h2>
    <blockquote>Michael Critchton</blockquote>
    <p>The plot is very much a rehash of <em>Jurrasic Park</em>, with (mostly) different characters on a different island. There are some interesting ideas and conversations about evolution though and like <em>Jurrasic Park</em>, once it gets going it's hard to put down.</p>
    <p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/being_mortal.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Being Mortal</h2>
    <blockquote>Atul Gawande</blockquote>
    <p>This is a must read for anyone with elderly people in their lives. Atul Gawande talks about how our modern healthcare systems care for, and fail to care for, the elderly. What choices we will be asked to make, and how we can make them in a way that optimises for quality of life rather than quantity.</p>

    <p>I was also fortunate to see Atul Gawande speak in Wellington on this same topic. He speaks at least as well as he writes.</p>

<div class="book">
  <img src="/images/books/how_buildings_learn.jpg" />
  <div class="summary">
    <h2>How Buildings Learn</h2>
    <blockquote>Stewart Brand</blockquote>

    <p>As someone interested in buildings and architecture I loved this book. It sets out to critique the current architecture industry and proposes a series of principles that form the foundation of good architecture, where 'good' is defined as architecture that survives the test of time.</p>

    <p>Many of the ideas discussed are generic design principles that can be applied to other disciplines of design and even software architecture.</p>
