title: The West Wing
---

I recently achieved a longstanding relationship goal: get my girlfriend Som to love The West Wing as much as I do, or at least almost as much as I do. 

Firstly, you have to understand; I love Aaron Sorkin's Tv shows. Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 and The Newsroom, I love them all.

The West Wing is the best of them all for a few reasons I can put my finger on and many I can't. Sorkin's dramatic style feels right at home in the White House. It has the strongest female characters. And of course it's the only one of Sorkin's shows to last more than 2 seasons (The Newsroom is about to start its third and final season, but those are short HBO seasons). 

When we first met Som didn't have the same level of interest in tv shows written by Aaron Sorkin, which is to say she had no interest at all. I forced her to watch a few episodes of Studio 60 and while she was very tolerant, I could tell that her heart wasn't in it. 

I gave up for a while, occasionally forcing upon her a particularly good West Wing episode until one day we started watching Parks and Recreation together. Parks is a great show; it's funny, has an awesome cast including the perfect female lead in Amy Poehler and tackles serious moral issues. It also has a lot in common with The West Wing.

Parks is a show about idealistic left leaning government employees who pour their heart and soul into their work but due to the nature of politics achieve only middling results. As is the West Wing.

So we started Parks and Recreation. Som loved it. We got through all 6 seasons in about a month. Then, in that moment of despair after watching the last episode of a show when you realize that there's no more, I suggested we try The West Wing again.

She was keen, she was ready. We just finished watching the first season of The West Wing and she loved it. She laughed, she cried, she's hooked.

Next up: Sports Night! Well, after finishing the next 6 seasons of The West Wing.

PS - If you haven't watched The West Wing you really, really should.
