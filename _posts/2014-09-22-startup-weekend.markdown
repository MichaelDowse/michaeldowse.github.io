### Mentoring is hard

After coming second in two previous startup weekends and founding an education startup that wasn’t a complete failure I signed up to be a mentor this time around. To be honest, I found it quite challenging. With so many mentors and so much combined expertise I felt a but under qualified.

As mentors we also tried to use the Socratic method: teach by asking questions. While I could often spot flaws and invalidated assumptions in a teams work I struggled to rephrase criticisms as constructive questions that would steer the team on the right path.

### Monetization is an unsolved problem in education

This is something we’ve struggled with a lot at Go Vocab. There is no proven model for monetizing an app used in the classroom. Maybe that’s not fair, there are proven models, but there’s no clear winner.

I was hoping to see some new ideas in this area at Startup Weekend but I was disappointed to see a lot of teams with vague monetization plans and a lot of social enterprises that seemed closer to charities than businesses.

### There’s still a lot of opportunity

On Friday night 45 people up to pitch their idea. Sure, some were near duplicates but that’s still a lot of ideas. Partly because of the monetization challenges mentioned above edtech, and specifically subject specific apps for use in the classroom has been largely ignored

I have no grand conclusion to make. If you’re at all interested in startup weekend and haven’t been to one then you definitely should. It’s an amazing experience.
