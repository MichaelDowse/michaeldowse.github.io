      </h2>
        
      <p>At the end of last year my friend Joel introduced me to Lemon Curd, or more specifally, to Lemon Curd on toast. I’d had lemon curd before, it’s commonly used in desserts, but using it as a breakfast spread was new to me, and I liked it.</p>

<p>So… I tried making Lemon Curd myself (sorry, this is turning into a cooking blog). I used the recipe provided by Joel which is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>4 large lemons</li>
  <li>100g butter</li>
  <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Grate the rind &amp; squeeze the juice of the lemons into a saucepan</li>
  <li>Cut butter into small cubes</li>
  <li>Beat the eggs</li>
  <li>Add the butter eggs and sugar to the saucepan and stir over a very low heat until the sugar has dissolved &amp; the curd has thickened</li>
  <li>Pour mixture into hot sterilized jar</li>
  <li>Let it stand to cool to room temperature then place in fridge</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/lemon_curd.jpg" alt="There's lemon zest somewhere underneath all that sugar" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s lemon zest somewhere underneath all that sugar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turned out pretty well! Ideally it would have been a bit thicker (I didn’t really have the patience for stirring slowly over a very low heat for too long), but the taste is just right.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2014/10/26/stuff-by-rss.html">Stuff by RSS</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>I generally avoid mainstream news media sites, for content discovery at least, I often click links to their articles. I do find myself reading <a href="http://stuff.co.nz">Stuff</a> though, and almost always regretting it. At one point I had stuff.co.nz routed to localhost in my hosts file so that my computer literally couldn’t access it.</p>

<p>But the reason I keep going back to Stuff is that there’s national news there that I don’t really get anywhere else. I started wondering, what would Stuff look like with a different editor, who wasn’t interested in maximising revenue, or catering to the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p>On Friday morning I read this tweet from Ben Gracewood:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;How much will rates go up?&#10;It is too early to say.&quot;&#10;&#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/nzherald">@nzherald</a> saved you a click. <a href="http://t.co/rqqrFJyGxh">http://t.co/rqqrFJyGxh</a></p>&mdash; Ben Gracewood (@nzben) <a href="https://twitter.com/nzben/status/525334208437182464">October 23, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>“Saved you a click”, is a common sight on Twitter. Editors have started writing headlines that deliberately omit a key fact so that readers are forced to click through and read the article (and view some ads in the process). By rewriting a headline, or including a few extra words, it’s possible to avoid the need to click through and read the whole article.</p>

<p>What if the editor put the reader ahead of the advertiser and was <em>trying</em> to save you a click? The headlines and excerpts would be written to include as many facts as possible.</p>

<p>What if the editor prioritised content based on their own opinions and ideas instead of catering to the lowest common denominator? The way content is arranged would change, entire sections of content would disappear.</p>

<p>I was planning to build a Chrome Addon to layer some of this functionality on top of Stuff.co.nz, and in doing so came accross the Stuff RSS feeds. There’s an RSS feed for each page on the site and in my opinion, the feeds are better than the website itself.</p>

<p>For example the headline <strong>‘Dodgy’ taxis shut down</strong> on the Stuff homepage becomes <strong>$20 ‘sober driver’ taxi page shut down</strong> in the RSS feed. <strong>Beware of backyard chickens</strong> on the homepage becomes <strong>Backyard chicken lead poisoning alert</strong> in the RSS feed, and so on. The RSS feeds also have useful excerpts (sadly not the full articles)</p>

<p>So instead of a chrome addon, I came up with <a href="http://stuffbyrss.dowse.co.nz/" target="_blank">Stuff by RSS</a>. It’s a minimalist alternative homepage for Stuff which may save you a click in some cases, and at the very least will spare you from ‘Stuff Nation’ and ‘Essential Mums’. <a href="http://stuffbyrss.dowse.co.nz/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>This doesn’t replace the editorial team at Stuff, but maybe they don’t need to be completely replaced. To me it’s a clear improvement over the current Stuff homepage. I’d love to keep expanding the scope of Stuff by RSS from here to the point where headlines and excerpts are being rewritten and perhaps even additional content added.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2014/10/19/cold-flat-white.html">Cold Flat White</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>Last year the Iced Mocha was my drink; a cold coffee with chocolate, and either ice cream or ice. Some would say it’s not a real coffee, I say it’s delicious.</p>

<p>It may seem impractical to drink iced coffee in winter, it didn’t stop me, but some find the idea a bit jarring. Anyway, now that summer is approaching there’s no excuse not to embrace iced coffee.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I discovered my favorite coffee of all: the Cold Flat White from <a href="http://peoplescoffee.co.nz/">People’s Coffee</a> (conveniently located only a few blocks from my house in Newtown). The Cold Flat White is a simple drink: cold brewed coffee, milk, and a touch of Maple Syrup. It’s delicious and I strongly recommend trying it.</p>

<p>Two problems: it costs $6 and is only available in Newtown. I needed an affordable and never ending supply of this stuff so I started making my own. That’s right, I make Cold Flat Whites at home and you can too.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-cold-brew-coffee">Step 1: Cold Brew Coffee</h3>

<p>Turns out <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/07/20/cheap-easy-no-mess-cold-brew.html">cold brewing coffee is stupidly simple</a>. Get some medium grind coffee, put it in a giant teabag (more specifically a nut milk bag, like you’d use to make almond milk), put it in some water and leave it overnight.</p>

<p>I was doubtful that the giant teabag approach could work as well as a Chemex filter, and having never used a Chemex I’m still not sure. It worked pretty well though, the resulting coffee was smooth and not at all gritty.</p>

<p><img src="/images/coffee.jpg" alt="Doesn't look appetizing, but..." /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doesn’t look appetizing, but…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a night of brewing squeeze the giant teabag so as to extract every last bit of coffee goodness. Then you’re left with a strong cold brewed coffee essence, I wouldn’t recommend drinking this straight.</p>

<p>If you used a whole bag of coffee like I did then you’ll have a lot of this coffee essence. That’s alright, it will last a while, store it in the fridge.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-make-a-cold-flat-white">Step 2: Make a Cold Flat White</h3>

<p>Now you’re ready to assemble a cold flat white. I’m still experimenting with the ratios here but it goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A couple of drops of Maple Syrup in the bottom of a glass</li>
  <li>Fill the glass with 50% coffee essence</li>
  <li>Fill the rest of the glass with milk</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s really all there is to it, enjoy!</p>

<p>I’m going to keep perfecting this: the next step is to increase the quality of the ingredients: really good freshly ground coffee, really good fresh organic milk, perhaps from Lewis Road Creamery, and real Maple Syrup (I must confess I’m currently using Maple Flavoured syrup).</p>

      <p>This weekend Som and I went for a quick overnight tramp into the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/wellington-kapiti/wellington/catchpool-and-orongorongo-valleys/">Orongorongo Valley</a>. The goal was to test out a bunch of new gear and generally make sure we’re ready to tackle some bigger tramps like the Queen Charlotte.</p>

<p><img src="/images/orongorongos-track.jpg" alt="The track in to the river" /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>We followed the track along the Catchpool Valley until it met the Orongorongo Valley, then walked upriver a bit until we found a suitable campsite.</p>

<p>For Dinner we cooked pasta with  eggplant and mushrooms and for breakfast we had Banana Loaf (prepared earlier). Then on sunday morning we walked back the way we came in.</p>

<p>There was only one slight mishap: I left the car keys at the campsite and didn’t notice until we were 15 minutes into the walk home. Thankfully they were exactly where I left them.</p>

<p>All our gear worked great and so now we’re all set for the next adventure. The weather was perfect and it didn’t rain at all, which is great, though it means that the waterproofness of my new tent remains untested.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2014/10/05/the-west-wing.html">The West Wing</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>I recently achieved a longstanding relationship goal: get my girlfriend Som to love The West Wing as much as I do, or at least almost as much as I do.</p>

<p>Firstly, you have to understand; I love Aaron Sorkin’s Tv shows. Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 and The Newsroom, I love them all.</p>

<p>The West Wing is the best of them all for a few reasons I can put my finger on and many I can’t. Sorkin’s dramatic style feels right at home in the White House. It has the strongest female characters. And of course it’s the only one of Sorkin’s shows to last more than 2 seasons (The Newsroom is about to start its third and final season, but those are short HBO seasons).</p>

<p>When we first met Som didn’t have the same level of interest in tv shows written by Aaron Sorkin, which is to say she had no interest at all. I forced her to watch a few episodes of Studio 60 and while she was very tolerant, I could tell that her heart wasn’t in it.</p>

<p>I gave up for a while, occasionally forcing upon her a particularly good West Wing episode until one day we started watching Parks and Recreation together. Parks is a great show; it’s funny, has an awesome cast including the perfect female lead in Amy Poehler and tackles serious moral issues. It also has a lot in common with The West Wing.</p>

<p>Parks is a show about idealistic left leaning government employees who pour their heart and soul into their work but due to the nature of politics achieve only middling results. As is the West Wing.</p>

<p>So we started Parks and Recreation. Som loved it. We got through all 6 seasons in about a month. Then, in that moment of despair after watching the last episode of a show when you realize that there’s no more, I suggested we try The West Wing again.</p>

<p>She was keen, she was ready. We just finished watching the first season of The West Wing and she loved it. She laughed, she cried, she’s hooked.</p>

<p>Next up: Sports Night! Well, after finishing the next 6 seasons of The West Wing.</p>

<p>PS - If you haven’t watched The West Wing you really, really should.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2014/09/29/budgeting.html">Budgeting</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>This year I’ve found myself with a regular routine and a regular income which seemed to be draining out of my bank account impossibly fast so I decided to have a go at budgeting.</p>

<p>I set a goal of spending $500 a week to spend, setting the rest aside for tax, savings, international travel, whatever.</p>

<p>Every week $250 goes to a joint account to cover rent, bills and groceries. That leaves $250 to cover everything else: food, entertainment, transport and one off expenses like a new iPhone, clothes, haircuts, domestic travel.</p>

<p>Another thing to note: I consider this money allocated for spending, not saving. So if I have money left at the end of the week then I should allocate it to larger purchases which are split across several weeks like a new iPhone.</p>

<p>There’s a neat app I use on my computer called Rescuetime which tracks how I use my computer and then categorizes my time as productive, neutral or unproductive. So an hour spent programming would be considered productive and an hour spent on Facebook would be considered unproductive. Of course I have control over which activities are classified as productive or unproductive.</p>

<p>I wondered if I could do he same think with my budgeting. The way I see it, money is something I can use to survive, but beyond that it can also be used to achieve my goals in life.</p>

<p>So I classified my expenses using these rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Expenses that are essential to survive (rent, groceries) are neutral.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Expenses that help me achieve my goals (a tent for tramping, a trip to Queenstown for the marathon) are productive.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Expenses that do neither of the above (eating out, Netflix) are unproductive.</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are exceptions of course. For example, if I eat out with friends then I’ll count that expense as productive because spending time with friends is good and something I should do more of even though I haven’t explicitly stated it as a goal.</p>

<p>That probably sounds horribly confusing so far but it works, here’s what it looks like for the past 3 weeks:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                    Week Ending 14/9	    Week Ending 21/9	    Week Ending 28/9
Total Spending      $410.06	              $434.42	              $409.08
Productive          $34.16	              $38.72	              $25.00
Neutral             $316.50	              $270.00	              $255.00
Unproductive        $59.40	              $125.70	              $129.08
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Since I started budgeting this way the amount I’ve been spending per week has been steadily decreasing (which leaves more money for stuff like my upcoming trip to do the Queen Charlotte track). I think it’s one of those cases where just being aware of something is enough to improve it.</p>

      </h2>
        
      <h3 id="mentoring-is-hard">Mentoring is hard</h3>

<p>After coming second in two previous startup weekends and founding an education startup that wasn’t a complete failure I signed up to be a mentor this time around. To be honest, I found it quite challenging. With so many mentors and so much combined expertise I felt a but under qualified.</p>

<p>As mentors we also tried to use the Socratic method: teach by asking questions. While I could often spot flaws and invalidated assumptions in a teams work I struggled to rephrase criticisms as constructive questions that would steer the team on the right path.</p>

<h3 id="monetization-is-an-unsolved-problem-in-education">Monetization is an unsolved problem in education</h3>

<p>This is something we’ve struggled with a lot at Go Vocab. There is no proven model for monetizing an app used in the classroom. Maybe that’s not fair, there are proven models, but there’s no clear winner.</p>

<p>I was hoping to see some new ideas in this area at Startup Weekend but I was disappointed to see a lot of teams with vague monetization plans and a lot of social enterprises that seemed closer to charities than businesses.</p>

<h3 id="theres-still-a-lot-of-opportunity">There’s still a lot of opportunity</h3>

<p>On Friday night 45 people up to pitch their idea. Sure, some were near duplicates but that’s still a lot of ideas. Partly because of the monetization challenges mentioned above edtech, and specifically subject specific apps for use in the classroom has been largely ignored</p>

<p>I have no grand conclusion to make. If you’re at all interested in startup weekend and haven’t been to one then you definitely should. It’s an amazing experience.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2014/09/15/housing.html">Housing availability: Renting vs buying</a>
      </h2>
        
      <p>I’ve been thinking about buying a house. I’m currently living in Newtown for the second time and I like it here, it’s close to town, but not in town and has it’s own community feel. A couple of months ago I started going to open homes to get a feel for the market. As time goes by I’m more and more ready to buy a house, and I’m becoming increasingly disappointed with what’s available on the market. Everything is expensive, really expensive.</p>

<p>After contemplating the reality that I may still be renting next year I had a brief look at the places to rent in Newtown on TradeMe. There are currently 57 properties available to rent in Newtown, which seemed like a lot considering that there are only 16 properties for sale. I was curious to see if this ratio was part of a bigger trend:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                Rent      Buy
NZ              10,172    Over 32,000
Auckland City   1,507     1,674
Wellington      913       952
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ok, so the disparity I observed in Newtown isn’t a nationwide trend. In general there are far more properties for sale than for rent, but in cities the split is pretty much 50/50. That makes sense. Let’s take a closer look at some popular Wellington suburbs[1]:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                Rent      Buy       Rent/Buy
Brooklyn        36        25        1.44
Churton Park    10        28        0.3571
Haitaitai       23        21        1.0952
Johnsonville    34        49        0.6938
Karori          49        46        1.0652
Kelburn         34        19        1.7895
Khandallah      32        49        0.6531
Kilbirnie       21        6         3.5
Miramar         23        32        0.7188
Mt Cook         26        30        0.8667
Mt Victoria     41        13        3.1538
Newlands        18        48        0.375
Newtown         57        16        3.5625
Oriental Bay    16        39        0.4103
Tawa            14        47        0.2979
Te Aro          59        109       0.5413
Thorndon        37        45        0.8222
Wadestown       23        8         2.875
CBD             158       112       1.4107
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Turns out, the ratio of houses for sale vs to rent varies widely. Newtown has the highest ratio of houses to rent vs houses for sale (Kilbirnie is a close second but at much lower volume). In contrast, Tawa and Newlands have far more houses for sale than for rent. Off the top of my head I can think of a few possible explanations for these variations, but I don’t want to jump to conclusions. One complicating factor is that many rental properties in Wellington are on 12 month leases which renew early in the year (usually February).</p>

<p>[1] Suburbs with either more than 20 properties for sale or more than 20 properties available to rent based on TradeMe listings on the 14th September, 2014.</p>
