      </h2>
      <p>We caught the train up to Mt Ruapehu on the weekend and caught the chairlift up to the new Knoll Ridge Cafe which is a very cool building (and has won at least one architecture award).</p>

      </h2>
      <p>At the end of last year my friend Joel introduced me to Lemon Curd, or more specifally, to Lemon Curd on toast. I’d had lemon curd before, it’s commonly used in desserts, but using it as a breakfast spread was new to me, and I liked it.</p>

<p>So… I tried making Lemon Curd myself (sorry, this is turning into a cooking blog).</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2014/10/26/stuff-by-rss.html">Stuff by RSS</a>
      </h2>
      <p>I generally avoid mainstream news media sites, for content discovery at least, I often click links to their articles. I do find myself reading <a href="http://stuff.co.nz">Stuff</a> though, and almost always regretting it. At one point I had stuff.co.nz routed to localhost in my hosts file so that my computer literally couldn’t access it.</p>

<p>But the reason I keep going back to Stuff is that there’s national news there that I don’t really get anywhere else. I started wondering, what would Stuff look like with a different editor, who wasn’t interested in maximising revenue, or catering to the lowest common denominator.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>Last year the Iced Mocha was my drink; a cold coffee with chocolate, and either ice cream or ice. Some would say it’s not a real coffee, I say it’s delicious.</p>

<p>It may seem impractical to drink iced coffee in winter, it didn’t stop me, but some find the idea a bit jarring. Anyway, now that summer is approaching there’s no excuse not to embrace iced coffee.</p>

      <p>This weekend Som and I went for a quick overnight tramp into the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/wellington-kapiti/wellington/catchpool-and-orongorongo-valleys/">Orongorongo Valley</a>. The goal was to test out a bunch of new gear and generally make sure we’re ready to tackle some bigger tramps like the Queen Charlotte.</p>

      <p>I recently achieved a longstanding relationship goal: get my girlfriend Som to love The West Wing as much as I do, or at least almost as much as I do.</p>

<p>Firstly, you have to understand; I love Aaron Sorkin’s Tv shows. Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 and The Newsroom, I love them all.</p>

      <p>This year I’ve found myself with a regular routine and a regular income which seemed to be draining out of my bank account impossibly fast so I decided to have a go at budgeting.</p>

<p>I set a goal of spending $500 a week to spend, setting the rest aside for tax, savings, international travel, whatever.</p>
