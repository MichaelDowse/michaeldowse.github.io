  <h3>Product & Technology Lead at Trees That Count</h3>

  <p>Trees remain the best technology we know for sequestering carbon. At Trees That Count we focus on getting more trees in the ground.</p>
  <p>During this time Claude Code and I became besties. Together we created an app for monitoring environmental restoration projects.

  <h3>Product Manager at Cogo</h3>

  <p>The climate crisis is a systemic problem which requires systemic change. But what does it mean to create systemic change?</p>
  <p>Should Consumers change their purchasing choices? Or is it businesses that should change what they do? Or should the government be writing laws to require change? Or is it voters who need to act, to give their government a mandate for change?</p>
  <p>Maybe it's everything, everywhere, all at once?</p>
  <p>At Cogo I led development of a new product to help small businesses <a href="https://www.cogo.co/products/for-small-businesses" target="_blank">measure, understand and reduce their carbon footprint</a>.</p>

  <h3>CTO at Hnry</h3>

  <p>I joined Hnry as an investor and technical lead and then later CTO. We made tax simple for freelancers and contractors by doing it for them automatically. I built and scaled our technology from processing hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of dollars. Serious business, hard work. We had some fun along the way too.</p>
  <p>I'm a data guy and at Hnry I got good at SaaS metrics. I even learned what venture capitalists dream of, apparently <a href="https://www.airtree.vc/airtree-blog/our-investment-in-hnry" target="_blank">it's Hnry's board decks</a>.</p>
  <p>If you earn independently in New Zealand or Australia <a href="https://hnry.co.nz" target="_blank">you could be using Hnry</a>.</p>

  <h3>Speaker at KiwiRuby</h3>

  <p>I became a father and learned that kids say the most ridiculous things. I gave a talk at KiwiRuby in 2019 titled <a href="/abstractions">“What my toddler taught me about abstraction”</a>.</p>

  <h3>Software Engineer at Flick Electric</h3>

  <p>I worked at Flick Electric as a software engineer and team lead. Our innovation was in allowing consumers to purchase electricity at the highly variable spot market rate. We believed in disintermediation. In the power of raw capitalism to drive down power prices and make consumers respond to the environmental impact of their electricity use. It worked for a little while.</p>
  <p>I developed carbon calculations and invented farting goats as a measure of carbon emissions. I later learned that goats are ruminants so most of their emissions come from burping.</p>

  <h3>Founder at Go Vocab</h3>

  <p>My first startup. It was the era of gamification, Farmville was at it's peak.</p>
  <p>We developed a fun way for high school second language students to learn vocabulary. There were points, leaderboards, trophies, badges, games… you get the picture. Students loved it and teachers loved that students were learning.</p>
  <p>I didn't love languages though, and also we did not make much money.</p>

  <h3>Writing</h3>

  <p>I have a <a href="/articles">blog</a> that I occasionally update. Nothing embarrassing, but anything more than a year old makes me cringe.</p>

  <h3>Reading</h3>

  <p>At various times I track <a href="/books">what I'm reading</a>. I have about a hundred books that I need to add to this list.</p>
