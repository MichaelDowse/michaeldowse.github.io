I briefly enrolled in architecture school and did a bunch of reading in preparation, not that Christopher Alexander agrees with the approach taught in architecture school at all. Every book about (building) architecture I read seems to give me more ideas on perspectives on software architecture.

I got this from the library because there are pictures.
