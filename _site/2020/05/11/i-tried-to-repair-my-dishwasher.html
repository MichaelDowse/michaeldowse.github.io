          </h2>
      
          <p>I’ve been handwashing dishes for a couple of weeks now. In the corner of my kitchen where the dishwasher should be sits a yawning gap in the cabinetry, and somehow it all started with fibre.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I didn’t really need faster internet, but I couldn’t resist getting upgrading my home ADSL connection to fibre. The ONT (fibre termination point) was installed in the kitchen so I moved the router to the new location but then reception in the bedrooms was not good.</p>

<p>So I took a drill to the kitchen cabinetry and ran an Cat 6 ethernet cable through the side of the bench. I dragged the dishwasher from where it’s been ensconced safely under the bench for many years and ran the cable behind, then around the front of the cabinets and up to the top of the fridge. The router was now within 1 metre of the geometric center of the house and reception in the bedrooms improved.</p>

<p>A few days later the dishwasher stopped working.</p>

<p>I pressed the same button that I press every day but instead of making watery dishwashery sounds it just beeped twice back at me. I turned it off, and then on again. Beep beep. I turned it off, took twenty minutes to make dinner and then turned it back on. Beep beep.</p>

<p>I found the manual buried deep in the back of the pot cupboard and read it cover to cover. There were only a couple of pages on troubleshooting, focusing on how to interpret the multitude of error codes which the dishwasher could display through the lights on its control panel. There are 10 lights and each can be either on or off, not dissimilar to binary code. Fortunately only twelve potential errors were described rather than the one thousand and twenty four possible combinations.</p>

<p>The lights looked the same to me as they always did and they didn’t resemble any of the error codes described in the manual. Besides, it was beeping at me. I read it again but the manual didn’t say anything about beeping.</p>

<p>I started looking online. Being a moderately practical person I was feeling confident that if I could just figure out what was going wrong then I would be able to fix it myself. Perhaps there would be a five minute Youtube video explaining exactly what to do.</p>

<p>I didn’t find anything on YouTube and the manufacturers site didn’t contain any further information beyond what’s in the manual. There were message boards though, lots of message boards filled with descriptions of dishwashers not working in every way you can imagine them not working. Especially beeping. There were lots of threads about dishwashers not washing dishes, just beeping.</p>

<p>Most of these threads received not response at all. The internet can be a busy town square filled with crowds of people heaving with humanity but it can also be incredibly quiet and empty. That’s how these threads tended to feel; just descriptions of broken dishwashers shouted into the vast emptiness.</p>

<p>The only time these pages ever get seen is when they’re dredged up from the depths of these message boards to be shown to another poor soul experiencing the exact same situation. In this case that was me.</p>

<p>Two hours later while diligently reading an article titled “8 reasons your dishwasher may be beeping at you” I came to the frustrating realisation that identifying the problem with my dishwasher was beyond my capabilities, let alone repairing it.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day I called the number on the manual, provided by the dishwasher manufacturer for these kinds of situations. The warranty which covers the first two years had long expired, though still, less than ten years had passed. Surely a dishwasher should last ten years?</p>

<p>They said they’d send someone out later in the week.</p>

<hr />

<p>A couple of days later a man turned up to look at my dishwasher. He fiddled with it for a few minutes before announcing “It’s a really strange one. It should be at least trying to start the pump, but it just beeps.”</p>

<p>I concurred, “So whats next”.</p>

<p>“I can take it back to my workshop”</p>

<p>“How much will that cost”</p>

<p>“Worst case, if it’s in the electronics we’ll have to replace the whole control panel, they cost four hundred, maybe five fundred bucks”.</p>

<p>I tapped “Bunnings dishwasher” into my phone. You can buy a new one for four hundred and sixty nine bucks. It’s better to repair what you’ve got though, right?</p>

<p>“Let’s do it”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the guys to come pick it up in the truck next week, and that’ll be one hundred and eight dollars for the callout fee for today”.</p>

<p>As I pulled my wallet from my pocket I mentally added one hundred and eight dollars to five hundred bucks. More than the cost of a new dishwasher.</p>

<hr />

<p>That night I was on the phone to my dad and mentioned my diswasher situation.</p>

<p>“Do you run it on eco mode”</p>

<p>“Yes, I always run it on eco mode”</p>

<p>“I always run it on fast wash which only takes thirty minutes. I have a theory that eco mode places more wear and tear on the machine because it runs longer”.</p>

<p>I thought about this for a minute. Eco wash cycles do take longer to run than normal cycles, and a lot longer to run than fast, or express cycles. In return they claim to use less water and electricity. This needs to be balanced against the wear and tear on the machine, since there’s no point saving a few kilowatts of electricity if the machine itself then lasts half as long.</p>

<p>Surely the manufacturers are across this I thought as I tapped “Should I use eco mode dishwasher” into my phone.</p>

<p>The US based Energy Star program introduced the current set of standards most dishwashers conform to, coming into effect in 2012. These standards limit the amount of water and electricity dishwashers can use in normal modes. Eco mode goes even further, minimising as much as possible the water and electricity usage without compromising on cleaning power. Fast mode gets to play fast and loose with the rules, it can use as much water and electricity as it likes in pursuit of a shorter cycle time.</p>

<p>If it seems counter-intuitive that running a dishwasher for longer can use less electricity then that’s because it is. It works because the electricity required to run the pump is minor compared to the electricity required to heat water, and a cycle that runs for longer can do so using water heated to a lower temperature.</p>

<p>Putting aside electicity usage though, running the pump for three times as long must shorten the life of the pump accordingly. Nonetheless my google search produced a pretty clear consensus: If you care about the environment then you should use eco mode. If eco mode is a conspiracy, it’s a deeply hidden one.</p>

<p>As an aside, you may by now be thinking; Michael, if you care so much about this why don’t you wash dishes by hand. Having spent some time reading up on the topic I am now able to cite you a 2004 study that compared hand washing to dishwashers and found that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
If you can afford an automatic dishwasher, use one—preferably a new one. A full, energy-efficient dishwasher cleans best and has the lowest environmental impact of any method. - <a href="http://www.homeenergy.org/show/article/page/9/id/180">http://www.homeenergy.org/show/article/page/9/id/180</a>
</div>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<hr />

<p>Four days later two more men and a large truck turned up. I’d spent the last 10 minutes frantically clearing a path wide enough for a dishwasher through the layer of toys and abandoned artworks that covered the floor of the hallway.</p>

<p>It only took them ten minues to manhandle the dishwasher out of it’s home under the sink, down the stairs and out to their truck. Then they were gone.</p>

<p>As the truck reversed down the driveway, I started on the pile of dishes by the sink.</p>
