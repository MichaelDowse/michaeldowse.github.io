      <p>I’ve been handwashing dishes for a couple of weeks now. In the corner of my kitchen where the dishwasher should be sits a yawning gap in the cabinetry, and somehow it all started with fibre.</p>

      <p>A while ago I read this article: <a href="https://hackernoon.com/complexity-and-strategy-325cd7f59a92">Complexity and Strategy</a></p>

<p>I highly recommend reading it. It’s much better than any of my blog posts.</p>

<p>One sentence that still lingers in my mind two months later is this one:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<em>Features interact — intentionally — and that makes the cost of implementing the N+1 feature closer to N than 1.</em>

      <p>You are a startup. You know design is important. It’s so important that you hire a super talented designer to make sure everything you make is beautiful.</p>

<p>Your designer produces a beautiful new design for your homepage which they predict will boost conversions. You need conversions. You are losing money. You get a developer onto it straight away.</p>

<p>If we have the luxury of choosing then the way we choose to spend out money is an expression of our values is an expression of our values. Intentionally or not. So I did some analysis of my voting patterns…</p>

<p>To go viral on Facebook a video needs to catch your attention, without any sound, while you’re scrolling through the news feed. The Tasty videos do that, I stop scrolling every time.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>I’ve always struggled with blogging. I want to do it, I have things that I want to share. But it always happens in bursts, a few good posts create a high bar for future posts, which get half written but never published.</p>

<p>Mostly I agonise over what I should be blogging about. Should I post my travel pictures? Should I be posting my own introspections? Or should I be posting my commentary on things?</p>

      <p>At the end of last year my friend Joel introduced me to Lemon Curd, or more specifally, to Lemon Curd on toast. I’d had lemon curd before, it’s commonly used in desserts, but using it as a breakfast spread was new to me, and I liked it.</p>

<p>So… I tried making Lemon Curd myself (sorry, this is turning into a cooking blog).</p>

      </h2>
      <p>I generally avoid mainstream news media sites, for content discovery at least, I often click links to their articles. I do find myself reading <a href="http://stuff.co.nz">Stuff</a> though, and almost always regretting it. At one point I had stuff.co.nz routed to localhost in my hosts file so that my computer literally couldn’t access it.</p>

<p>But the reason I keep going back to Stuff is that there’s national news there that I don’t really get anywhere else. I started wondering, what would Stuff look like with a different editor, who wasn’t interested in maximising revenue, or catering to the lowest common denominator.</p>

      <p>Last year the Iced Mocha was my drink; a cold coffee with chocolate, and either ice cream or ice. Some would say it’s not a real coffee, I say it’s delicious.</p>

<p>It may seem impractical to drink iced coffee in winter, it didn’t stop me, but some find the idea a bit jarring. Anyway, now that summer is approaching there’s no excuse not to embrace iced coffee.</p>
