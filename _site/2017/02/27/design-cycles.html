          <p>You are a startup. You know design is important. It’s so important that you hire a super talented designer to make sure everything you make is beautiful.</p>

<p>Your designer produces a beautiful new design for your homepage which they predict will boost conversions. You need conversions. You are losing money. You get a developer onto it straight away.</p>

<p><em>Two years pass by…</em></p>

<hr />

<p>You have interfaces everywhere, not because distributed systems are on trend right now but because your customers are distributed. There’s the public website, the web app, the mobile version of the website, the iphone app, the android app, the Tumblr blog, the API documentation, the SaaS Job Board product you’ve integrated with and written a custom theme for.</p>

<p>There are emails as well of course; some from your app and some from your marketing automation system, plus the life cycle emails from that other SaaS product.</p>

<p>You’re launching a new page of your website targeting a new niche of customers. Your designer has done some designs in a super cool new style. It will probably increase conversions, you get a developer onto it straight away.</p>

<p>The thing is, the new designs for the new page don’t really match the rest of the site. It’s kind of a different style. The skeumorphic buttons are out, flat rectangles are in. Textured backgrounds are out, huge background images are in. The logo and branding is the same though.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, nothing really matches. The mobile site looks a bit outdated, but you have apps now. The apps look a bit different to the web app, but your iOS developer is busy on another project. The public facing site looks great, it gets updated the most so it has the latest designs.</p>

<p>The inconsistency bothers you, it’s a bad experience for your customers and it doesn’t look good to prospects, it might even be affecting conversion rates. Design is important. Not more important that conversions or course, but still, it would be nice if everything matched the nice new designs.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>

<p>Visit your banks website, it probably looks pretty nice, that’s because it’s trying to convert you. Now log into online banking, probably not so nice. Now try logging in to your banks online business banking portal, the ones I have seen are all about a decade behind the design of the banks home page.</p>

<p>It’s easy to pick on banks, but every startup that’s been around for more than a couple of years struggles to maintain a cohesive look and feel across all customer touchpoints.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons for this, one I’ve been thinking about lately is about cycle times. More specifically, about the mismatch between an organisation’s design cycle time and its design implementation cycle time. Those are terms I made up, but you can think of them something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Design Cycle Time:</strong> How frequently our visual style changes or evolves, this varies depending on the designer/design team, brand changes as you seek product/market fit etc. For example, it could be about 6 months.</p>

<p><strong>Design Implementation Cycle Time:</strong> The time it takes for all your interfaces to be updated to a new design. In my experience this varies from 3 months to infinite (all interfaces are never brought into alignment), with the median around 2 years.</p>

<p>If your Design Cycle Time is 6 months, and your Design Implementation Cycle Time is 2 years. The customer experience won’t be terrible, but it won’t cohesive, and that holds it back.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  <em>To ensure a mostly consistent customer experience most of the time, a companies design implementation cycle time must be significantly shorter than its design cycle time.</em>
</div>

<p>In framing the problem this way, two approaches to solving it emerge: increasing design cycle time, or reducing design implementation cycle time. Ideally both approaches would be pursued in parallel.</p>

<p>Before tackling cycle times though, it is essential to understand your interfaces. I’ve never witnessed a ‘complete redesign’ that managed to update every customer touchpoint. There’s always something that gets missed.</p>

<p>What about the merch store? What about the knowledge base? What about the monthly newsletter? These are the less important customer touchpoints but they all contribute to that feeling of cohesion, where the experience just feels right.</p>

<p>Once all of your interfaces are documented, then you can begin to make improvements.</p>

<h3 id="to-increase-design-cycle-time">To increase Design Cycle Time</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Avoid trends, stick to the classics</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design in a wider context</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep short lived designs contained:</strong> Sometimes visual styles have to change fast, that’s how marketing campaigns work. They just need to be treated as such. Design changes for a particular campaign should be implemented as a skin, or theme across the more permanent “evergreen” style to make removing them at the end of the campaign simple.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="to-decrease-design-implementation-cycle-time">To decrease Design Implementation Cycle Time</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Know your interfaces:</strong> Know what interfaces you have, where they are and maintain the capability to update them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pattern Libraries:</strong> A topic for another blog post, but a well maintained and used pattern library really is the best solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Update designs by default:</strong> When working on an interface, never leave a interface without updating the design.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
