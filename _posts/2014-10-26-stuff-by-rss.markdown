I generally avoid mainstream news media sites, for content discovery at least, I often click links to their articles. I do find myself reading [Stuff](http://stuff.co.nz) though, and almost always regretting it. At one point I had stuff.co.nz routed to localhost in my hosts file so that my computer literally couldn't access it.

But the reason I keep going back to Stuff is that there's national news there that I don't really get anywhere else. I started wondering, what would Stuff look like with a different editor, who wasn't interested in maximising revenue, or catering to the lowest common denominator.<!--more-->

On Friday morning I read this tweet from Ben Gracewood:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;How much will rates go up?&#10;It is too early to say.&quot;&#10;&#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/nzherald">@nzherald</a> saved you a click. <a href="http://t.co/rqqrFJyGxh">http://t.co/rqqrFJyGxh</a></p>&mdash; Ben Gracewood (@nzben) <a href="https://twitter.com/nzben/status/525334208437182464">October 23, 2014</a></blockquote>

"Saved you a click", is a common sight on Twitter. Editors have started writing headlines that deliberately omit a key fact so that readers are forced to click through and read the article (and view some ads in the process). By rewriting a headline, or including a few extra words, it's possible to avoid the need to click through and read the whole article. 

What if the editor put the reader ahead of the advertiser and was _trying_ to save you a click? The headlines and excerpts would be written to include as many facts as possible.

What if the editor prioritised content based on their own opinions and ideas instead of catering to the lowest common denominator? The way content is arranged would change, entire sections of content would disappear.

I was planning to build a Chrome Addon to layer some of this functionality on top of Stuff.co.nz, and in doing so came accross the Stuff RSS feeds. There's an RSS feed for each page on the site and in my opinion, the feeds are better than the website itself.

For example the headline **'Dodgy' taxis shut down** on the Stuff homepage becomes **$20 'sober driver' taxi page shut down** in the RSS feed. **Beware of backyard chickens** on the homepage becomes **Backyard chicken lead poisoning alert** in the RSS feed, and so on. The RSS feeds also have useful excerpts (sadly not the full articles)

So instead of a chrome addon, I came up with [Stuff by RSS](http://stuffbyrss.dowse.co.nz/){:target="_blank"}. It's a minimalist alternative homepage for Stuff which may save you a click in some cases, and at the very least will spare you from 'Stuff Nation' and 'Essential Mums'. [Check it out](http://stuffbyrss.dowse.co.nz/){:target="_blank"}.

This doesn't replace the editorial team at Stuff, but maybe they don't need to be completely replaced. To me it's a clear improvement over the current Stuff homepage. I'd love to keep expanding the scope of Stuff by RSS from here to the point where headlines and excerpts are being rewritten and perhaps even additional content added.
