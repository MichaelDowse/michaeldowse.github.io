At the end of last year I discovered Lemon Curd on toast. I'd had lemon curd before, it's commonly used in desserts, but using it as a breakfast spread was new to me, and I liked it.

So... I tried making Lemon Curd myself (sorry, this is turning into a cooking blog). I used the recipe provided by Joel which is as follows:

###Ingredients:

- 4 large lemons
- 100g butter
- 2 cups of sugar
- 4 eggs

###Instructions:

1. Grate the rind & squeeze the juice of the lemons into a saucepan
2. Cut butter into small cubes
3. Beat the eggs
4. Add the butter eggs and sugar to the saucepan and stir over a very low heat until the sugar has dissolved & the curd has thickened
5. Pour mixture into hot sterilized jar
6. let it stand to cool to room temp then place in fridge
