        <a class="post-link" href="/2020/05/11/i-tried-to-repair-my-dishwasher.html">My dishwasher broke and I tried to fix it</a>
      </h2>
      <p>I’ve been handwashing dishes for a couple of weeks now. In the corner of my kitchen where the dishwasher should be sits a yawning gap in the cabinetry, and somehow it all started with fibre.</p>

<p>I didn’t really need faster internet, but I couldn’t resist getting upgrading my home ADSL connection to fibre. The ONT (fibre termination point) was installed in the kitchen so I moved the router to the new location but then reception in the bedrooms was not good.</p>

<p>So I took a drill to the kitchen cabinetry and ran an Cat 6 ethernet cable through the side of the bench. I dragged the dishwasher from where it’s been ensconced safely under the bench for many years and ran the cable behind, then around the front of the cabinets and up to the top of the fridge. The router was now within 1 metre of the geometric center of the house and reception in the bedrooms improved.</p>

<p>A few days later the dishwasher stopped working.</p>

<p>I pressed the same button that I press every day but instead of making watery dishwashery sounds it just beeped twice back at me. I turned it off, and then on again. Beep beep. I turned it off, took twenty minutes to make dinner and then turned it back on. Beep beep.</p>

<p>I found the manual buried deep in the back of the pot cupboard and read it cover to cover. There were only a couple of pages on troubleshooting, focusing on how to interpret the multitude of error codes which the dishwasher could display through the lights on its control panel. There are 10 lights and each can be either on or off, not dissimilar to binary code. Fortunately only twelve potential errors were described rather than the one thousand and twenty four possible combinations of lights being on or off.</p>

<p>The lights looked the same to me as they always did and they didn’t resemble any of the error codes described in the manual. Besides, it was beeping at me. I read it again but the manual didn’t say anything about beeping.</p>

<p>I started looking online. Being a moderately practical person I was feeling confident that if I could just figure out what was going wrong then I would be able to fix it myself. Perhaps there would be a five minute Youtube video explaining exactly what to do.</p>

<p>I didn’t find anything on YouTube and the manufacturers site didn’t contain any further information beyond what’s in the manual. There were message boards though, lots of message boards filled with descriptions of dishwashers not working in every way you can imagine them not working. Especially beeping. There were lots of threads about dishwashers not washing dishes, just beeping.</p>

<p>Most of these threads received not response at all. The internet can be a busy town square filled with crowds of people heaving with humanity but it can also be incredibly quiet and empty. That’s how these threads tended to feel; just descriptions of broken dishwashers shouted into the vast emptiness.</p>

<p>The only time these pages ever get seen is when they’re dredged up from the depths of these message boards to be shown to another poor soul experiencing the exact same situation. In this case that was me.</p>

<p>Two hours later while diligently reading an article titled “8 reasons your dishwasher may be beeping at you” I came to the frustrating realisation that identifying the problem with my dishwasher was beyond my capabilities, let alone repairing it.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day I called the number on the manual, provided by the dishwasher manufacturer for these kinds of situations. The warranty which covers the first two years had long expired, though still, less than ten years had passed. Surely a dishwasher should last ten years?</p>

<p>They said they’d send someone out later in the week.</p>

<hr />

<p>A couple of days later a man turned up to look at my dishwasher. He fiddled with it for a few minutes before announcing “It’s a really strange one. It should be at least trying to start the pump, but it just beeps.”</p>

<p>I concurred, “So whats next”.</p>

<p>“I can take it back to my workshop”</p>

<p>“How much will that cost”</p>

<p>“Worst case, if it’s in the electronics we’ll have to replace the whole control panel, they cost four hundred, maybe five fundred bucks”.</p>

<p>I tapped “Bunnings dishwasher” into my phone. You can buy a new one for four hundred and sixty nine bucks. It’s better to repair what you’ve got though, right?</p>

<p>“Let’s do it”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the guys to come pick it up in the truck next week, and that’ll be one hundred and eight dollars for the callout fee for today”.</p>

<p>As I pulled my wallet from my pocket I mentally added one hundred and eight dollars to five hundred bucks. More than the cost of a new dishwasher.</p>

<hr />

<p>That night I was on the phone to my dad and mentioned my diswasher situation.</p>

<p>“Do you run it on eco mode”</p>

<p>“Yes, I always run it on eco mode”</p>

<p>“I always run it on fast wash which only takes thirty minutes. I have a theory that eco mode places more wear and tear on the machine because it runs longer”.</p>

<p>I thought about this for a minute. Eco wash cycles do take longer to run than normal cycles, and a lot longer to run than fast, or express cycles. In return they claim to use less water and electricity. This needs to be balanced against the wear and tear on the machine, since there’s no point saving a few kilowatts of electricity if the machine itself then lasts half as long.</p>

<p>Surely the manufacturers are across this I thought as I tapped “Should I use eco mode dishwasher” into my phone.</p>

<p>The US based Energy Star program introduced the current set of standards most dishwashers conform to, coming into effect in 2012. These standards limit the amount of water and electricity dishwashers can use in normal modes. Eco mode goes even further, minimising as much as possible the water and electricity usage without compromising on cleaning power. Fast mode gets to play fast and loose with the rules, it can use as much water and electricity as it likes in pursuit of a shorter cycle time.</p>

<p>If it seems counter-intuitive that running a dishwasher for longer can use less electricity then that’s because it is. It works because the electricity required to run the pump is minor compared to the electricity required to heat water, and a cycle that runs for longer can do so using water heated to a lower temperature.</p>

<p>Putting aside electicity usage though, running the pump for three times as long must shorten the life of the pump accordingly. Nonetheless my google search produced a pretty clear consensus: If you care about the environment then you should use eco mode. If eco mode is a conspiracy, it’s a deeply hidden one.</p>

<p>As an aside, you may by now be thinking; Michael, if you care so much about this why don’t you wash dishes by hand. Having spent some time reading up on the topic I am now able to cite you a 2004 study that compared hand washing to dishwashers and found that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
If you can afford an automatic dishwasher, use one—preferably a new one. A full, energy-efficient dishwasher cleans best and has the lowest environmental impact of any method. - <a href="http://www.homeenergy.org/show/article/page/9/id/180">http://www.homeenergy.org/show/article/page/9/id/180</a>
</div>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<hr />

<p>Four days later two more men and a large truck turned up. I’d spent the last 10 minutes frantically clearing a path wide enough for a dishwasher through the layer of toys and abandoned artworks that covered the floor of the hallway.</p>

<p>It only took them ten minues to manhandle the dishwasher out of it’s home under the sink, down the stairs and out to their truck. Then they were gone.</p>

<p>As the truck reversed down the driveway, I started on the pile of dishes by the sink.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2017/04/23/decoupling.html">Decoupling isn't just for developers</a>
      </h2>
      <p>A while ago I read this article: <a href="https://hackernoon.com/complexity-and-strategy-325cd7f59a92">Complexity and Strategy</a></p>

<p>I highly recommend reading it. It’s much better than any of my blog posts.</p>

<p>One sentence that still lingers in my mind two months later is this one:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<em>Features interact — intentionally — and that makes the cost of implementing the N+1 feature closer to N than 1.</em>
</div>

<p>In every organisation I’ve been a part of it goes this way: At first adding new features is fast and easy but as the codebase grows, it gets exponentially harder and slower.</p>

<p>I’ve always ascribed this to technical debt, but that never felt quite right. The codebases weren’t that bad, yet adding new features still kept getting harder.</p>

<p>Now it all makes sense. New features usually interact with existing features, so the more existing features there are that need to be interacted with, the harder it is to add a new feature.</p>

<hr />

<p>I saw a good example of this in Slack just now. I write most of my blog posts, including this one, while on vacation. When I left work I used Slack’s new “status” feature to set my status to one of the defaults: “Vacationing”.</p>

<p>I was suprised to find that setting my status in this way did not affect my notification settings in any way. I kept getting notifications from my workmates until I used a separate feature to “Snooze Notifications”.</p>

<p>The status feature is completely decoupled from the notification settings functionality. They do not interact in any way.</p>

<p>While I was initially suprised that setting my status to “Vacationing” did not change my notification settings, can you imagine the confusion if it had? Even if it was well communicated in the UI, it would leave me confused about how different statuses affected my notifications. What if I set my status to “At Lunch”, would I expect that to also mute notifications? What if I ignored the default statuses and created a custom status of “On Holiday”?</p>

<p>Decoupled features are generally easier for users to understand than features that interact with one another in complex ways.</p>

<p>To understand why Slack did this, it helps to understand the context: The notifications functionality is already very complex. Check out this diagram of how Slack decides whether to send a notification:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When Hacker News commenters say &quot;I could build that app in a weekend!&quot; I think of this chart of how Slack decides to send a notification. <a href="https://t.co/LopicAyzkL">pic.twitter.com/LopicAyzkL</a></p>&mdash; Matt Haughey (@mathowie) <a href="https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/837735473745289218">March 3, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Slack already have a lot of features that interact with notification settings in a complex way, if they had designed statuses to interact with notification settings as well it would have vastly increased the cost of adding this new feature.</p>

<p>Adding features in a decoupled way like Slack did with Statuses avoids interactions between features which reduces overall complexity in the system and makes it easier to add new functionality.</p>

<hr />

<p>Good developers are always trying to decouple things, to minify the ways in which different pieces of code interact with each other. It’s one of the main selling points of the current hot trend: microservices.</p>

<p>Decoupling can’t be purely the concern of developers though. Software architecture and product design are inescapably linked. If the product design specifies that features interact with each other, then to a certain extent the developers’ hands are tied.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean product designers need to understand software architecture, microservices and decoupling. Nor does it mean that we should elevate technical concerns over user experience.</p>

<p>It means we need to be conscious of the ways features interact with one another. To understand that interactions between features add complexity to the product and that complexity is expensive.</p>

<p>Complex interactions between features can make it harder for users to understand how the product works, and are guaranteed to slow down development of new features.</p>

<p>With that in mind, let us go forth and make trade-offs.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2017/02/27/design-cycles.html">Design cycles</a>
      </h2>
      <p>You are a startup. You know design is important. It’s so important that you hire a super talented designer to make sure everything you make is beautiful.</p>

<p>Your designer produces a beautiful new design for your homepage which they predict will boost conversions. You need conversions. You are losing money. You get a developer onto it straight away.</p>

<p><em>Two years pass by…</em></p>

<hr />

<p>You have interfaces everywhere, not because distributed systems are on trend right now but because your customers are distributed. There’s the public website, the web app, the mobile version of the website, the iphone app, the android app, the Tumblr blog, the API documentation, the SaaS Job Board product you’ve integrated with and written a custom theme for.</p>

<p>There are emails as well of course; some from your app and some from your marketing automation system, plus the life cycle emails from that other SaaS product.</p>

<p>You’re launching a new page of your website targeting a new niche of customers. Your designer has done some designs in a super cool new style. It will probably increase conversions, you get a developer onto it straight away.</p>

<p>The thing is, the new designs for the new page don’t really match the rest of the site. It’s kind of a different style. The skeumorphic buttons are out, flat rectangles are in. Textured backgrounds are out, huge background images are in. The logo and branding is the same though.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, nothing really matches. The mobile site looks a bit outdated, but you have apps now. The apps look a bit different to the web app, but your iOS developer is busy on another project. The public facing site looks great, it gets updated the most so it has the latest designs.</p>

<p>The inconsistency bothers you, it’s a bad experience for your customers and it doesn’t look good to prospects, it might even be affecting conversion rates. Design is important. Not more important that conversions or course, but still, it would be nice if everything matched the nice new designs.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>

<p>Visit your banks website, it probably looks pretty nice, that’s because it’s trying to convert you. Now log into online banking, probably not so nice. Now try logging in to your banks online business banking portal, the ones I have seen are all about a decade behind the design of the banks home page.</p>

<p>It’s easy to pick on banks, but every startup that’s been around for more than a couple of years struggles to maintain a cohesive look and feel across all customer touchpoints.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons for this, one I’ve been thinking about lately is about cycle times. More specifically, about the mismatch between an organisation’s design cycle time and its design implementation cycle time. Those are terms I made up, but you can think of them something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Design Cycle Time:</strong> How frequently our visual style changes or evolves, this varies depending on the designer/design team, brand changes as you seek product/market fit etc. For example, it could be about 6 months.</p>

<p><strong>Design Implementation Cycle Time:</strong> The time it takes for all your interfaces to be updated to a new design. In my experience this varies from 3 months to infinite (all interfaces are never brought into alignment), with the median around 2 years.</p>

<p>If your Design Cycle Time is 6 months, and your Design Implementation Cycle Time is 2 years. The customer experience won’t be terrible, but it won’t cohesive, and that holds it back.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  <em>To ensure a mostly consistent customer experience most of the time, a companies design implementation cycle time must be significantly shorter than its design cycle time.</em>
</div>

<p>In framing the problem this way, two approaches to solving it emerge: increasing design cycle time, or reducing design implementation cycle time. Ideally both approaches would be pursued in parallel.</p>

<p>Before tackling cycle times though, it is essential to understand your interfaces. I’ve never witnessed a ‘complete redesign’ that managed to update every customer touchpoint. There’s always something that gets missed.</p>

<p>What about the merch store? What about the knowledge base? What about the monthly newsletter? These are the less important customer touchpoints but they all contribute to that feeling of cohesion, where the experience just feels right.</p>

<p>Once all of your interfaces are documented, then you can begin to make improvements.</p>

<h3 id="to-increase-design-cycle-time">To increase Design Cycle Time</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Avoid trends, stick to the classics</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design in a wider context</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep short lived designs contained:</strong> Sometimes visual styles have to change fast, that’s how marketing campaigns work. They just need to be treated as such. Design changes for a particular campaign should be implemented as a skin, or theme across the more permanent “evergreen” style to make removing them at the end of the campaign simple.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="to-decrease-design-implementation-cycle-time">To decrease Design Implementation Cycle Time</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Know your interfaces:</strong> Know what interfaces you have, where they are and maintain the capability to update them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pattern Libraries:</strong> A topic for another blog post, but a well maintained and used pattern library really is the best solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Update designs by default:</strong> When working on an interface, never leave a interface without updating the design.</p>

<p>I try to spend in a responsible way, considering the direct &amp; indirect consequences of my purchases. Not all my spending is conscious in this way, it’s hard work to put so much thought into each purchase. Some heuristics are now starting to emerge which I hope to document soon.</p>

<p>Some (unordered) attributes I think about when spending money consciously:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consumption of the product is good for me personally</li>
  <li>My consumption of the product is not detrimental to society as a whole</li>
  <li>The company treats staff well</li>
  <li>Sustainable supply chain</li>
  <li>The end product is sustainable</li>

<p>I’m hoping that as I make decisions on certain products (e.g. where to buy coffee) that don’t need to be repeated the percentage of conscious spending will increase. That’s the theory at least.</p>

<p class="caption">[1] Highly underestimated as I often have a prepaid coffee card</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2016/04/17/tasty.html">Tasty</a>
      </h2>
      <p>If you use Facebook, you’ve probably noticed the recipe videos from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty/?fref=ts">Tasty</a> frequently featuring on your news feed. They’re everywhere right now.</p>

<p>To go viral on Facebook a video needs to catch your attention, without any sound, while you’re scrolling through the news feed. The Tasty videos do that, I stop scrolling every time. Here’s one for example:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbuzzfeedtasty%2Fvideos%2F1741611326091509%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560" width="560" height="425" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Given this, I wasn’t particularly surprised to find out that Tasty is a part of Buzzfeed. I normally don’t like viral things in my feed but I do like these Tasty videos and I’ve been able to rationalise a couple of possible justifications:</p>

<p><strong>Cooking is a good thing that we should do more of and Tasty videos encourage that</strong></p>

<p>Most people agree that we should cook more. Just like we should exercise more, or read more books. These are things that most people feel are positive influences on their lives, and that we should do more of.</p>

<p>You could say that reality shows like MasterChef encourage cooking, and for some people they probably do, but they also promote sitting on the couch watching other people cook, and then paying exorbitant prices to eat a meal prepared in a kitched overseen by a “MasterChef”.</p>

<p>Tasty videos serve less as entertainment and more as inspiration. While you couldn’t make the meal just from watching the video, you <em>almost</em> could, and there’s always a link to the full recipe attached.</p>

<p><strong>They promote <em>good</em> cooking</strong></p>

<p>Tasty recipes tend to start from scratch, using basic ingredients. There are no cake mixes, or pre-made anything.</p>

<p>The only inputs into the videos are relatively unprocessed ingredients that can be found in any supermarket, showing a committment to recipes that people can actually make at home. It’s just good business sense really, as the recipes need to appeal to people all over the world. Some of the competitors who have popped up are less principled, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/foodbyshared/videos/1018342061536144/?fref=nf">like this example</a>.</p>

<p>The recipes are often not particularly simple (though the video format makes them look deceptively so). They encourage the idea that cooking takes effort, but that your effort will be rewarded.</p>

<hr />

<p>Convinced? Here’s a couple more:</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2016/03/10/kiwisaver.html">Choosing a Socially Responsible Kiwisaver Scheme</a>
      </h2>
      <p>I recently found myself making significant contributions to Kiwisaver for the first time so I decided to put an appropriate amount of effort into choosing the best Kiwisaver scheme.</p>

<p>With all my spending, I try to follow Ghandi’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/falser-words-were-never-spoken.html?_r=0">misquoted</a> advice:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  Be the change that you wish to see in the world
</div>

<p>When it comes to investing, this means investing in companies which are making a positive contribution to society &amp; the environment. From my cursory analysis of the 189 available Kiwisaver schemes there are 5 that are specifically targeted at investors like me.</p>

<h3 id="quaystreet-balanced-sri-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/craigs-investment-partners-kiwistart-defined-scheme---balanced-sri-fund-craigs-investment-partners-/">QuayStreet Balanced SRI Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Craigs Investment Partners</em> this fund invests in investments that Craigs “deems to be environmentally sustainable or socially responsible”. A pretty broad mandate.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Balanced</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 318</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $4,713,552</p>

<h3 id="socially-responsible-investment-growth-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/">Socially Responsible Investment Growth Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Grosvenor Investment Management</em>, this fund “will exclude companies and other investments where the underlying activities are principally involved in the tobacco, alcohol, gambling and armaments industries” which is a pretty low bar.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Growth</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 1,556</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $16,999,866</p>

<h3 id="socially-responsible-investment-balanced-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-balanced-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/">Socially Responsible Investment Balanced Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Grosvenor Investment Management</em>, this fund will exclude “investments which do not satisfy certain socially responsible investment criteria”.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Balanced</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 4,031</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $17,854,622</p>

<h3 id="sustainable-international-share-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/oneanswer-kiwisaver-scheme---sustainable-international-share-fund-anz-new-zealand-investments-limited/">Sustainable International Share Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>ANZ</em>, this fund invests exclusively in the <a href="http://funds.ft.com/uk/Tearsheet/Summary?s=LU0119216553:EUR">Global Sustainable Equity Fund</a> which “combines respect for social principles (such as human rights, non-discrimination and the issue of child labour) and environmental principles with good financial prospects”.</p>

<p>Despite only investing on one fund, this scheme still manages to charge above average fees.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Aggressive</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 362</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $4,305,412</p>

<h3 id="ethica-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/superlife---ethica-pool-superlife-limited/">Ethica Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Superlife</em>, this fund “looks to avoid investments in the areas of pornography, gambling, tobacco, alcohol, armaments and fossil fuel extraction”.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Balanced</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 937</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $12,406,942</p>

<hr />

<p>There are other options. Craigs offers <a href="https://www.craigsip.com/services/kiwisaver.aspx">a scheme where you can pick your own stocks</a>, and there may be other schemes which invest in a responsible manner but don’t explicitly flag that as their intention.</p>

<p>Looking purely at social responsibility it seems like the <a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/">Socially Responsible Investment Growth Fund</a> is the best option, but I will be following up some of the others for more details of their investment criteria. There are other factors to consider of course, such as risk profile, returns, and fees.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2015/12/19/new-plymouth.html">New Plymouth</a>
      </h2>
      <p>New Plymouth is a lot cooler than it used to be. Som and I headed up there for the weekend a few months ago. In no particular order, some highlights were:</p>

<h3 id="the-coastal-walkway">The coastal walkway</h3>

<p><img src="/images/newplymouth/walkway.jpg" alt="BMD" /></p>

<p>The coastal walkway is lovely, the water was a bit wild the day we went which made it all the more interesting. Unfortunately not caught on camera: when Som turned to photograph this sign a wave came up from behind and she got soaked.</p>

<h3 id="the-govett-brewster-len-lye-gallery">The Govett-Brewster Len Lye gallery</h3>

<p><img src="/images/newplymouth/lenlye.jpg" alt="BMD" /></p>

<p>The exterior is probably actually the highlight, but the stuff inside is cool too.</p>

<h3 id="mount-taranaki">Mount Taranaki</h3>

<p><img src="/images/newplymouth/taranaki.jpg" alt="BMD" /></p>

<p>There was too much snow to climb Mount Taranaki without actual mountaineering skills but I’ve climbed it on a previous trip and it’s a pretty awesome hike. When we went in the height of summer there was still snow at the top. If nothing else, it’s worth a trip to the visitors center halfway up the mountain for some sweet views.</p>

<h3 id="street-art">Street Art</h3>

<p><img src="/images/newplymouth/bmd.jpg" alt="BMD" /></p>

<p>New Plymouth is the home of <a href="http://bmdisyourfriend.com/">BMD</a> and there is a lot of their work, and cool work by other artists, throughout the city center.</p>

<h3 id="food--drink-that-was-up-to-the-standard-of-us-city-folk">Food &amp; drink that was up to the standard of us city folk</h3>

<ul>
  <li>For coffee, head to <a href="http://www.ozonecoffee.com/bean-store.php">Ozone Coffee</a></li>
  <li>For brunch, head to <a href="http://www.thefederalstore.com/">The Federal Store</a></li>
  <li>For dinner, head to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PEKAREN-696952050381686/">Pekaren</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Our AirBnB host was a nudist with a house full of <em>interesting</em> artwork, though the wall to wall mirrors in the shower were a little intimidating.</p>

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2015/12/19/blogging-goals.html">Rules of the blog</a>
      </h2>
      <p>I’ve always struggled with blogging. I want to do it, I have things that I want to share. But it always happens in bursts, a few good posts create a high bar for future posts, which get half written but never published.</p>

<p>Mostly I agonise over what I should be blogging about. Should I post my travel pictures? Should I be posting my own introspections? Or should I be posting my commentary on things? To help reduce my future agonising I’ve come up with two rules for this blog:</p>

<p><strong>1) Posts things of interest to others</strong></p>

<p>This is a public blog, not a personal diary. It’s not for my aimless musings. I mean it is for that, but not only that, and only when they might be of interest to others.</p>

<p><strong>2) Post things that no-one else could post</strong></p>

<p>I don’t want to write the same things that everyone else is writing. This means posts must have a personal angle, which sets up a tight balancing act with rule number one. Posts must be personal, but also of interest to others.</p>

<p>These two rules don’t eliminate any of the post types I described above: I can, and will, still post travel pictures, introspections, and commentary.</p>

<p>Let’s see how long this burst lasts.</p>
