          <p>Last year the Iced Mocha was my drink; a cold coffee with chocolate, and either ice cream or ice. Some would say it’s not a real coffee, I say it’s delicious.</p>

<p>It may seem impractical to drink iced coffee in winter, it didn’t stop me, but some find the idea a bit jarring. Anyway, now that summer is approaching there’s no excuse not to embrace iced coffee. <!--more--></p>

<p>Earlier this year I discovered my favorite coffee of all: the Cold Flat White from <a href="http://peoplescoffee.co.nz/">People’s Coffee</a> (conveniently located only a few blocks from my house in Newtown). The Cold Flat White is a simple drink: cold brewed coffee, milk, and a touch of Maple Syrup. It’s delicious and I strongly recommend trying it.</p>

<p>Two problems: it costs $6 and is only available in Newtown. I needed an affordable and never ending supply of this stuff so I started making my own. That’s right, I make Cold Flat Whites at home and you can too.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-cold-brew-coffee">Step 1: Cold Brew Coffee</h3>

<p>Turns out <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/07/20/cheap-easy-no-mess-cold-brew.html">cold brewing coffee is stupidly simple</a>. Get some medium grind coffee, put it in a giant teabag (more specifically a nut milk bag, like you’d use to make almond milk), put it in some water and leave it overnight.</p>

<p>I was doubtful that the giant teabag approach could work as well as a Chemex filter, and having never used a Chemex I’m still not sure. It worked pretty well though, the resulting coffee was smooth and not at all gritty.</p>

<p><img src="/images/coffee.jpg" alt="Doesn't look appetizing, but..." /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doesn’t look appetizing, but…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a night of brewing squeeze the giant teabag so as to extract every last bit of coffee goodness. Then you’re left with a strong cold brewed coffee essence, I wouldn’t recommend drinking this straight.</p>

<p>If you used a whole bag of coffee like I did then you’ll have a lot of this coffee essence. That’s alright, it will last a while, store it in the fridge.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-make-a-cold-flat-white">Step 2: Make a Cold Flat White</h3>

<p>Now you’re ready to assemble a cold flat white. I’m still experimenting with the ratios here but it goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A couple of drops of Maple Syrup in the bottom of a glass</li>
  <li>Fill the glass with 50% coffee essence</li>
  <li>Fill the rest of the glass with milk</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s really all there is to it, enjoy!</p>

<p>I’m going to keep perfecting this: the next step is to increase the quality of the ingredients: really good freshly ground coffee, really good fresh organic milk, perhaps from Lewis Road Creamery, and real Maple Syrup (I must confess I’m currently using Maple Flavoured syrup).</p>
