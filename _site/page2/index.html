      </h2>
      <p>This weekend Som and I went for a quick overnight tramp into the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/wellington-kapiti/wellington/catchpool-and-orongorongo-valleys/">Orongorongo Valley</a>. The goal was to test out a bunch of new gear and generally make sure we’re ready to tackle some bigger tramps like the Queen Charlotte.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>I recently achieved a longstanding relationship goal: get my girlfriend Som to love The West Wing as much as I do, or at least almost as much as I do.</p>

<p>Firstly, you have to understand; I love Aaron Sorkin’s Tv shows. Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 and The Newsroom, I love them all.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>This year I’ve found myself with a regular routine and a regular income which seemed to be draining out of my bank account impossibly fast so I decided to have a go at budgeting.</p>

<p>I set a goal of spending $500 a week to spend, setting the rest aside for tax, savings, international travel, whatever.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>I’ve been thinking about buying a house. I’m currently living in Newtown for the second time and I like it here, it’s close to town, but not in town and has it’s own community feel. A couple of months ago I started going to open homes to get a feel for the market. As time goes by I’m more and more ready to buy a house, and I’m becoming increasingly disappointed with what’s available on the market. Everything is expensive, really expensive.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>A year ago I wasn’t a runner, I didn’t run. Hadn’t since compulsory cross country in primary school. Now, when asked about my hobbies running is near the top of the list and I’m looking forward to my first half marathon (and hopefully a full marathon soon after). This is the story of how I became a runner.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>The flight into Cusco, Peru is intimidating, mountains close in on all sides forcing the plane to bank steeply as it dives into the valley. We get our first warning that this trip won’t be as warm as expected when the pilot announces that the ground temperature is 0 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Like everyone else we’re here to visit Machu Picchu and we’ve chosen a 5 day trek over mountains and through the jungle to get there.</p>
