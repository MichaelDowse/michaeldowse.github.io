    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>#1kk</h2>

<p>A year ago I wasn’t a runner, I didn’t run. Hadn’t since compulsory cross country in primary school. Now, when asked about my hobbies running is near the top of the list and I’m looking forward to my first half marathon (and hopefully a full marathon soon after). This is the story of how I became a runner.</p>

<p>In December 2012 Som and I started running. It was her idea but I liked it. We ran just a little bit, and very slowly, but we kept doing it, almost every day.</p>

<p>In the New Year <a href="http://www.8degrees.co.nz/2012/12/19/1000-1000/">Vaughan Rowsell announced his intention to run 1,000 kilometres</a> or 1,000,000 metres in 2013. Vaughan dubbed this challenge the #1kk.</p>

<p>Vaughan is a master of year long goals. Past goals of his include cycling the length of New Zealand and not drinking for a year. In contrast I’m not much of a goal setter and I’m even worse at finishing what I start.</p>

<p>Despite this, and despite the fact I could barely run 3k at the time, I committed to the challenge. Signing up is the easy part.</p>

<p>I opted to use the Nike Plus app to track my progress towards the #1kk which means I always take my iPhone with me on runs. If I don’t take the phone, then the run doesn’t count. So far I’ve tripped and fallen twice, damaging my phone on both occasions. The first time the back plate had to be replaced and the second time was scratches on the front. I try to use a case now.</p>

<p>In December I was running in my street shoes (Vans at the time) based on what I had heard from the barefoot running movement that modern running shoes did more harm than good. In January I decided to focus on only one challenge at a time and picked up some running shoes on sale for $100 at Rebel Sport.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/1kk/1.jpg" alt="My running shoes" />
<em>My running shoes</em></p>

<p>I didn’t put a lot of thought into my choice, I considered the fit, comfort, colours and price and came up with the Lunarfly trail running shoes from Nike. The fit was a bit tight at first but has come to be perfect as I’ve worn them in. I use these shoes for a lot more than running too, I took them hiking in Patagonia and trekking in Peru. If I’m going away for the weekend then this is the one pair of shoes I take.</p>

<p>Building on the habits we started forming in December we continued running in January, gradually increasing our distance and speed. Moving to Santiago really threw off our barely formed running habits; in February and March we didn’t run at all. The habit was broken and The #1kk was not looking good.</p>

<p>In April we planned a hiking trip to Patagonia and resumed running as training for the trip. We established a simple 5k route from our apartment which we ran most mornings with a longer run on Sundays. After the trip to Patagonia we started running even more. At one point we were running 50k per week, more than twice as much as required for the challenge.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/1kk/2.png" alt="I’ve run over 700k so far this year" />
<em>I’ve run over 700k so far this year</em></p>

<p>It’s now the beginning of September, two thirds of the way through the year and I’ve run just over 700 kilometres. That puts me more than 30k ahead of schedule but I expect that lead to disappear fast as I’m traveling at the moment and not running much. It’s likely that December will be a mad rush towards the finish line but what seemed unachievable in March now seems simple: all I have to do is not give up.</p>

<p>That’s what running is about for me: not stopping.</p>

<p>I used to cycle quite a bit, on and off road and when you’re cycling up a hill (or on the flat) you can’t stop pedaling  You can pedal extremely slowly but you can’t stop. If you stop, then best case you’ll roll backwards down the hill, or worst case you’ll tip over sideways.</p>

<p>It’s easier to stop when running, there’s less momentum forcing one foot down in front of the other. This makes for a mental sport. It’s all about the mind games.</p>

<p>YOUTUBE CLIP HERE</p>

<p>At first it was hard to get out of bed every morning, to run, and to keep running when I wanted nothing more than to be back in bed. It’s still hard, some days more than others. But it’s getting easier.</p>

<p>I usually run a line, there and back (as opposed to a loop) and the return journey always feels easier, like running downhill. I’m reminded of a quote from Gattaca when the two brothers are swimming away from shore to see who will chicken out first:</p>

<p><strong>Anton:</strong> Vincent! How are you doing this Vincent? How have you done any of this? We have to go back.</p>

<p><strong>Vincent:</strong> It’s too late for that. We’re closer to the other side.</p>

<p><strong>Anton:</strong> What other side? You wanna drown us both?</p>

<p><strong>Vincent:</strong> You wanna know how I did it? This is how I did it Anton &ndash; I never saved anything for the swim back.</p>

<p>Peer pressure helps, Som and I usually run together and there are many times I’ve thought ‘If I were alone I’d slow down now’, or ‘If I were alone I’d walk for a bit now’. If I’m running alone then music helps too.</p>

<p>The mind games get easier when there’s no doubt that I can’t finish the run. When I set out on a 5, 7, or even 10k run I know I can finish it. I’ve done it 100 times before. Unless there’s something really wrong with me on the day I must be physically capable of finishing the run. There’s no excuse.</p>

<p>Running is a habit, and it naturally builds on itself. Getting out of bed every morning gets easier, putting on the shoes becomes a muscle memory. Every run is easier than the last.</p>

<p>Success in one habit makes it easier to succeed in other habits. I’m trying to introduce more positive habits into my life, and also to apply the discipline I’ve learned from running to other areas. I highly recommend The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg to learn more about the science behind habits.</p>

<p>Though I haven’t finished the #1kk yet I’ve established the habit, and all I have to do now is not stop.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Machu Picchu</h2>

<p>The flight into Cusco, Peru is intimidating, mountains close in on all sides forcing the plane to bank steeply as it dives into the valley. We get our first warning that this trip won’t be as warm as expected when the pilot announces that the ground temperature is 0 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Like everyone else we’re here to visit Machu Picchu and we’ve chosen a 5 day trek over mountains and through the jungle to get there.</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<p>The first thing I felt disembarking was the cold, the pilot’s forecast was spot  on and a T-shirt and hoodie was not suitable attire. The second thing I felt was how thin the air was. At 3400 metres above sea level it takes some time to acclimatise to Cusco. Upon arrival at our hostel we were offered Coca tea, a staple of the Andean diet which helps the body cope with the altitude (yes, the same Coca plant that cocaine is derived from).</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/1.jpg" alt="Plaza De Armas in Cusco" />
<em>Plaza De Armas in Cusco</em></p>

<p>We spent the next two days is Cusco acclimatising and gathering supplies for our trip including sunblock, insect repellent, flashlights and water purification tablets.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of tour companies offering Machu Picchu treks, with seemingly very little differentiation. Walking around Cusco we were accosted every few metres with offers of Machu Picchu tours and if you’re flexible you can probably save money by signing up only a day or two in advance. Based on a friend’s recommendation and TripAdvisor we booked our tour a few months in advance with BioAndean, a 100% Peruvian company who advertised a maximum group size of 10.</p>

<p>The Inca Trail is the most famous and therefore most popular route to Machu Picchu, unfortunately that means it’s crowded, expensive and booked out months in advance. We chose the Salkantay trek instead which takes a different route over a higher mountain pass than the Inca Trail.</p>

<p>The night before our trek began we met our guide Edwin and our fellow trekkers: A couple from Minnesota, a couple from Washington, DC, two friends from New York plus Som and I made 8.</p>

<p>After two days of acclimatising we were still getting short of breath climbing a single flight of stairs and the rest of the group seemed like experienced trekkers so confidence was not high. But it was far too late to turn back.</p>

<h3>Day 1: Warmup</h3>

<p>3:30am is a completely unreasonable time to wake up. We rushed our last hot shower for 4 days and headed out to wait for our van. Breakfast was a 3 hour drive away in a tiny village halfway up a mountain. By 9am we were at the trailhead donning rain pants and ponchos under a light rain.</p>

<p>Here we met the rest of the team helping us on the trek. As well as our guide Edwin there was Amazing (real name: Amansio) the chef, Alfredo the assistant chef, and two horsemen.</p>

<p>Most of our gear was carried by mules led by one of the horsemen, who sped ahead with the chefs to prepare our meals and campsites. The other horsewoman led an extra horse requested by one of our group with a leg injury. So our trekking party consisted of 8 trekkers, 1 guide, 1 horsewoman, 1 horse (mule) and 1 dog.</p>

<em>The trek begins! Keeping our feet dry so far</em></p>

<p>We walked for about 4 hours before lunch, mostly uphill on a track, sometimes on a 4WD road for patches. I wasn’t sure what kind of food to expect on the trip but lunch was definitely amazing. We started with a tea, then a cauliflower pizza entree, then a soup, and then the main course: four huge platters of food in the middle of the table. The chef Amazing had earned his nickname.</p>

<p>After lunch we walked a few more hours to our first campsite where we found our tents set up and our thermarests inflated.</p>

<h3>Day 2: The mountain pass</h3>

<p>By the start of the second we’d learned everyone’s names. Noah and Amanda from Washington, both mathematicians working for the government. Luke, a murse (male nurse) and Keegan (a doctor) from Minnesota. Lauren and Julie, both therapists from New York.</p>

<p>The second day is the hardest, we had been warned. On the first day we walked only 10km, the second day called for more than 20km. That meant an early start, we were woken at 5.15 with hot Coca tea.</p>

<p>After an amazing breakfast of fruit salad and pancakes we set out to climb over the Salkantay mountain pass. The light rain quickly turned to snow. We walked uphill for 3 and a half hours as the gentle snow turned into a blizzard.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/4.jpg" alt="Climbing up in the snow" />

<p>Edwin showed no sign of concern though and we reached the top of the pass without incident, took some quick photos and rushed down the other side towards lunch.</p>

<em>Brief celebrations at the top</em></p>

<p>Lunch was a low point of the trip; we were freezing cold, wet and had terrible headaches from the altitude. After lunch things started to improve, we walked down the mountain until we entered the jungle and its mosquito inhabitants.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/6.jpg" alt="Heading down into the jungle" />

<p>The rest of the way to the campsite was a pleasant stroll through the jungle with amazing views around every turn.</p>

<h3>Day 3: The promise of hot pools</h3>

<p>The third day was a recovery day which meant a sleep in &ndash; until 6am. The schedule called for 5 hours walking before lunch, then the afternoon was free for visiting the local hot pools.</p>

<p>As we continued to trek through the jungle Edwin pointed out various orchids, edible plants including wild strawberries and poisonous white caterpillars which suddenly appeared everywhere. There were caterpillars on the track, around the track and even dangling in midair above the track.</p>

<em>A natural thermal spring we passed on the way, a teaser of hot pools to come</em></p>

<p>All our campsites featured some facilities and a tiny shop, which was super helpful when I misplaced our toothbrushes and toothpaste. This time the campsite was on the outskirts of a small village which meant more amenities including a flat screen TV!</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/8.jpg" alt="Time for some shopping" />
<em>Time for some shopping</em></p>

<p>After another amazing lunch we piled into a van to take us to the hot pools. Some locals rode on the roof. Edwin had neglected to mention that we had to drive “the road of death” to get there, with a massive cliff on one side. We survived, and the hot pools were worth it (photos to come courtesy of Luke’s waterproof camera).</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/9.jpg" alt="Hot pools at last!" />
<em>Hot pools at last!</em></p>

<p>That night Chef Amazing managed to bake a very impressive cake in a pot which I hadn’t seen done before but apparently this is called a Dutch oven.</p>

<h3>Day 4: The Inca Trail</h3>

<p>As Edwin explained to us there’s the ‘Inca Trail’ and then there are other Inca trails, 16,000 kilometres worth on total. On the fourth day we walked on an Inca trail through coffee plantations and past waterfalls. We also saw banana plants, lemon-orange trees, passionfruit, avocados, and several varieties of wild potatoes.</p>

<p>Just before lunch we passed a set of partially excavated Incan ruins which used to serve as a lodging house for Incan messengers who would carry coded messages between Incan cities. Archaeologists are constantly rediscovering Incan ruins to this day and as they do so our knowledge of the Incan civilization continues to evolve.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/10.jpg" alt="Incan ruins we passed along the way" />
<em>Incan ruins we passed along the way</em></p>

<p>After lunch we walked along train tracks (we were also given the option of catching the train) to Aguas Calientes, the town at the bottom of Macchu Pichu. Having finally returned to civilisation we dined at a restaurant and had palta rellena as an entree, a fantastic dish consisting of an avocado cut open and filled with other vegetables.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/11.jpg" alt="Walking along the train tracks" />
<em>Walking along the train tracks</em></p>

<p>But that’s just the first of the luxuries we experienced in Aguas Calientes. We stayed in a hostel, in a private room with an ensuite and sometimes-hot showers. And of course Wifi.</p>

<h3>Day 5: Machu Picchu</h3>

<p>Another 3.30am start. Luke, Keegan, Som and I elected to walk up 2,000 stairs to Machu Picchu. The others caught the bus up. That’s how we found ourselves at 4.45am chatting to an Australian while waiting for the gate to open. It’s not a race but it felt like one as we overtook other groups climbing the stairs.</p>

<p>There’s was a predawn fog hanging around the mountains giving everything a mystic feel as we walked up. We reached the top well before dawn but instead of burning off the fog closed in. We donned rainjackets and missed the sunrise.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/12.jpg" alt="The fog before closing in" />
<em>The fog before closing in</em></p>

<p>By 8am the fog finally started to clear much to everyone’s relief and we started taking lots of photos.</p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/13.jpg" alt="The fog clears" />
<em>The fog clears</em></p>

<p>Then we started our climb up Waynapichu, a small peak overlooking the main ruins. This took about an hour and involved climbing some very steep steps with terrifying drop offs. We were rewarded with amazing views down on Machu Picchu.</p>

<em>The climb up Waynapichu</em></p>

<p><img src="http://MichaelDowse.github.io/images/machu-picchu/15.jpg" alt="The view from the top" />
<em>The view from the top</em></p>

<p>By 2pm we’d been awake for over 10 hours, 8 of which were spent at Machu Picchu. We’d visited all the sites on the map and taken hundreds of photos. Mission accomplished, time to go home.</p>

<p>2,000 steps down, 2 dinners, a train ride and a van ride later we were back at our hostel in Cusco. All up we walked over 80 kilometres.</p>

<p>I highly recommend visiting Machu Picchu and also BioAndean as a tour company. I think the Salkantay route was the best for us but they have many different routes with different focuses (cultural, adventure, etc). I also highly recommend Waynapichu which is an optional extra.</p>

<p>There are plenty more photos from the trip on Facebook:</p>
