          <p>I recently found myself making significant contributions to Kiwisaver for the first time so I decided to put an appropriate amount of effort into choosing the best Kiwisaver scheme.</p>

<p>With all my spending, I try to follow Ghandi’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/falser-words-were-never-spoken.html?_r=0">misquoted</a> advice:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
  Be the change that you wish to see in the world
</div>

<p>When it comes to investing, this means investing in companies which are making a positive contribution to society &amp; the environment. From my cursory analysis of the 189 available Kiwisaver schemes there are 5 that are specifically targeted at investors like me.</p>

<h3 id="quaystreet-balanced-sri-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/craigs-investment-partners-kiwistart-defined-scheme---balanced-sri-fund-craigs-investment-partners-/">QuayStreet Balanced SRI Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Craigs Investment Partners</em> this fund invests in investments that Craigs “deems to be environmentally sustainable or socially responsible”. A pretty broad mandate.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Balanced</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 318</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $4,713,552</p>

<h3 id="socially-responsible-investment-growth-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/">Socially Responsible Investment Growth Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Grosvenor Investment Management</em>, this fund “will exclude companies and other investments where the underlying activities are principally involved in the tobacco, alcohol, gambling and armaments industries” which is a pretty low bar.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Growth</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 1,556</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $16,999,866</p>

<h3 id="socially-responsible-investment-balanced-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-balanced-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/">Socially Responsible Investment Balanced Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Grosvenor Investment Management</em>, this fund will exclude “investments which do not satisfy certain socially responsible investment criteria”.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Balanced</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 4,031</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $17,854,622</p>

<h3 id="sustainable-international-share-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/oneanswer-kiwisaver-scheme---sustainable-international-share-fund-anz-new-zealand-investments-limited/">Sustainable International Share Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>ANZ</em>, this fund invests exclusively in the <a href="http://funds.ft.com/uk/Tearsheet/Summary?s=LU0119216553:EUR">Global Sustainable Equity Fund</a> which “combines respect for social principles (such as human rights, non-discrimination and the issue of child labour) and environmental principles with good financial prospects”.</p>

<p>Despite only investing on one fund, this scheme still manages to charge above average fees.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Aggressive</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 362</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $4,305,412</p>

<h3 id="ethica-fund"><a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/superlife---ethica-pool-superlife-limited/">Ethica Fund</a></h3>

<p>Provided by <em>Superlife</em>, this fund “looks to avoid investments in the areas of pornography, gambling, tobacco, alcohol, armaments and fossil fuel extraction”.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Balanced</p>

<p><strong>Members:</strong> 937</p>

<p><strong>Total Value:</strong> $12,406,942</p>

<hr />

<p>There are other options. Craigs offers <a href="https://www.craigsip.com/services/kiwisaver.aspx">a scheme where you can pick your own stocks</a>, and there may be other schemes which invest in a responsible manner but don’t explicitly flag that as their intention.</p>

<p>Looking purely at social responsibility it seems like the <a href="http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/fund/grosvenor-kiwisaver-scheme---socially-responsible-investment-fund-grosvenor-investment-management-limited/">Socially Responsible Investment Growth Fund</a> is the best option, but I will be following up some of the others for more details of their investment criteria. There are other factors to consider of course, such as risk profile, returns, and fees.</p>
