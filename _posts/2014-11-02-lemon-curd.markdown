At the end of last year my friend Joel introduced me to Lemon Curd, or more specifally, to Lemon Curd on toast. I'd had lemon curd before, it's commonly used in desserts, but using it as a breakfast spread was new to me, and I liked it.

So... I tried making Lemon Curd myself (sorry, this is turning into a cooking blog). I used the recipe provided by Joel which is as follows:

###Ingredients:

- 4 large lemons
- 100g butter
- 2 cups of sugar
- 4 eggs

###Instructions:

1. Grate the rind & squeeze the juice of the lemons into a saucepan
2. Cut butter into small cubes
3. Beat the eggs
4. Add the butter eggs and sugar to the saucepan and stir over a very low heat until the sugar has dissolved & the curd has thickened
5. Pour mixture into hot sterilized jar
6. Let it stand to cool to room temperature then place in fridge

It turned out pretty well! Ideally it would have been a bit thicker (I didn't really have the patience for stirring slowly over a very low heat for too long), but the taste is just right.
